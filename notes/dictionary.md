title: Thoughts on a Simple Digital Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian

Wait a minute, there are a lot of dictionaries of Ancient Egyptian. Why do we need another one?

We don’t, actually. It’s just that I have some opinions about how to make lexical data 1) as future-proof as possible, 2) as simple as possible, and 3) as useful as possible. 

## Existing dictionaries

Here’s a short list of existing dictionaries of Ancient Egyptian with links to archive.org where available:

* [Erman and Grapow’s Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache](https://archive.org/details/woerterbuchderag01erman) (1926-1961)
* [Adolf Erman’s Egyptian Grammar](https://archive.org/details/egyptiangrammar00ermagoog) (1894)
* [Adolf Erman’s Egyptian Dictionary](https://archive.org/details/egyptiandictiona00ermarich) (1926)
* [Raymond Faulkner’s A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian](https://archive.org/details/concisedictionar0000faul) (1962)
