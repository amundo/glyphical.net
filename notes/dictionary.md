Wait a minute, there are a lot of dictionaries of Ancient Egyptian. Why do we need another one?

We don’t, actually. It’s just that I have some opinions about how to make lexical data 1) as future-proof as possible, 2) as simple as possible, and 3) as useful as possible. 

## Existing dictionaries

Here’s a short list of existing dictionaries of Ancient Egyptian with links to archive.org where available:

* [Adolf Erman’s Egyptian Grammar](https://archive.org/details/egyptiangrammar00ermagoog) (1894)
* [Adolf Erman’s Egyptian Dictionary](https://archive.org/details/egyptiandictiona00ermarich) (1926)
* [Raymond Faulkner’s A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian](https://archive.org/details/concisedictionar0000faul) (1962)



## What difference does a digital dictionary make?

The most obvious difference between a digital dictionary and a print dictionary is that a digital dictionary can be searched and sorted in ways that a print dictionary cannot. This is not simply a matter of being able to carry out a string search over a text (although that is a big advantage). It is also a matter of being able to search in a _granular_ way—by limiting searches to particular fields, for example, or by searching for words that are tagged with particular attributes.

## Granularity

I think the term “granularity” here is one worth focusing on. Granularity is the degree to which a system is broken down into smaller parts. In the case of a dictionary, granularity is the degree to which the data is broken down into smaller parts, and crucially into _named_ parts. For instance, consider these two
