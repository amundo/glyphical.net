    <p>I have become rather obsessed with learning about Ancient
    Egyptian. As my background is in web-based language documentation, I
    am interested in the way that Egyptian text is digitized. I’m also
    interested in issues of usability in working with digital linguistic
    data. Digital Egyptology, if that’s a thing, offers a lot of
    interesting challenges in this regard.</p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-type-hieroglyphs">How do I type hieroglyphs?</h2>
    <p>I have to confess that I find the available options for inputting
    hieroglyphs too specialized. It seems that the quasi-standard input
    method out there is either input the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_de_Codage">Manuel de
    Codage</a> or “MdC” system to specify hieroglyphs, and then use a
    conversion system of some kind. The main tool that people seem to
    use for this is Serge Rosmorduc ’s <a
    href="https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/">JSesh</a>, which is a very
    nice piece of software which has been well maintained over the
    years, and is very active. (<a
    href="http://aoineko.free.fr/">WikiHiero</a> is another tool, but it
    doesn’t go to Unicode hieroglyphs.)</p>
    <p>There are many other tools that cover various aspects of handling
    hieroglyphic text, but for me they all fail in one regard: I don’t
    know many hieroglyphs, so finding in a list takes a long time. Even
    when the software provides a list, carrying out a visual search
    among… well, suppose you are looking for the “headstand guy”:</p>
    <div style="font-size:3rem">
    𓀡
    </div>
    <p>How long does it take you to find him in the list?</p>
    <p>In JSesh, you’d navigate to the “Man and his occupations”
    category, and eventually you’d find him:</p>
    <p><img src="images/jsesh-a-category.png" alt="Searching for a sign via menus in JSesh"></p>
    <p>There he sits, er, hand-stands, at <code>A29</code>. Not too
    bad.</p>
    <p>But what if you don’t know the name of the sign? What if you
    don’t know the Gardiner category? You almost certainly haven’t
    memorized the Gardiner number — there are over 1000 of them! So
    there’s nothing for it but to search. And search. And search.</p>
    <h2 id="whats-wrong-with-the-gardiner-classification-system">What’s
    wrong with the Gardiner classification system?</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing wrong with the Gardiner <em>classification</em>
    system. It does that fine. The problem is that the same sign can
    reasonably be classified in more than one way. Wikipedia offers <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardiner%27s_sign_list">a good
    summary of the problem</a>, with regard to this sign:</p>
    <div style="font-size:3rem">
    𓅒
    </div>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Gardiner does not cross-index signs; once put on the list, other
    significant uses may be overlooked. One example of this is 𓅒
    <code>G16</code>, <em>nbtỉ</em>, the ideogram for the Two Ladies,
    goddesses Wadjet as the cobra and Nekhbet as the white vulture.
    These are the protective and patron goddesses of the separate
    Egyptian kingdoms that joined into ancient Egypt, who were both then
    displayed on the uraeus of Wadjet when the unification occurred and
    afterward considered jointly to be the protectors of Egypt and the
    pharaohs. This ideogram is listed only in the bird list (G), and
    overlooked on the deity list (C) and the reptile list (I).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I don’t know about you, but my reaction is “what the heck is this
    thing doing in the <code>Bird</code> category”?</p>
    <p><img src="images/jsesh-g-category.png" alt="Searching for a sign via menus in JSesh"></p>
    <p>And then, there are signs that are just <em>weird</em>, like this
    one:</p>
    <div style="font-size:3rem">
    𓍐
    </div>
    <p>What the heck is that? A spark plug? What category is it in? As
    it happens, it’s a variant of</p>
    <div style="font-size:3rem">
    𓍏
    </div>
    <p>…which is a “drill for beads”… which is in the “Agriculture,
    crafts, and professions” category. Alrighty then. It’s not that it’s
    a bad classification or something, it’s just that it’s not
    predictable from looking at the hieroglyph itself.</p>
    <h2 id="just-use-manuel-de-codage-codes">Just use Manuel de Codage
    codes…</h2>
    <p>So, I hear you say, “That’s why we have <a
    href="http://www.catchpenny.org/codage/">Manuel de Codage</a>.” I’m
    no expert, but I don’t see that as a solution either, because it
    assumes that you know the values for all the hieroglyphs. Clearly,
    while that may be a viable approach for more experienced students,
    but it’s not a good solution for learners — they simply aren’t
    familiar enough with hieroglyphs, let alone remembering MdC codes.
    There’s also the irritating byproduct of using Manuel de Codage that
    it tends to become a <em>replacement</em> for Unicode hieroglyphs,
    even though they came about decades ago, when Unicode hieroglyphs
    were not available. I for one want to see the actual characters I’m
    studying, not a transliteration of them. One still encounters
    sometimes vociferous voices online suggesting that new students
    should <em>only</em> work in MdC. Personally, I think that’s a
    mistake. And I’m <a href="https://thotsignlist.org/About">not</a>
    the <a
    href="https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/publications/2012b.pdf">only
    one</a> who thinks so.</p>
    <p>Incidentally, I’m on talking about <em>finding hieroglyphs</em>
    here, not specifying what their <em>readings</em> are (that is,
    whether a given hieroglyph is being used as a phonetic,
    determinative, or ideogram in a given context). The whole topic of
    annotating the readings of hieroglyphs is a whole ’nother can of
    worms, but for me at least, until there’s a story for writing down
    he hieroglyphs reasonably effectively, that problem is out of scope.
    And anyway, <a href="https://thotsignlist.org/About">other people
    are already working on those</a>.</p>
    <h2
    id="its-not-just-categorization-we-need-we-also-need-tagging.">It’s
    not just categorization we need — we also need tagging.</h2>
    <p>What if you were trying to talk to another student of Ancient
    Egyptian about a particular hieroglyph? How would you describe a
    given sign? I can think of lots of ways, and I’m sure you can as
    well:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>𓀡
    <ul>
    <li>“The upside-down guy.”</li>
    <li>“The headstand one.”</li>
    <li>“The one walking on his hands.”</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>𓅒
    <ul>
    <li>“The uraeus hieroglyph.”</li>
    <li>“That one with the snake in it.”</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Etc, etc. What it really comes down to is something more akin to
    <em>tagging</em> or <em>labeling</em> than classification. In fact,
    we can think of other, weirder ways to “tag” hieroglyphs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>𓅒
    <ul>
    <li>“two-by-two grid” - the layout</li>
    <li>“two baskets” - counting sub-signs</li>
    <li>“Wadjet” - relevant name</li>
    <li>“Nekhbet” - relevant name</li>
    <li>“Two Ladies” - relevant label</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>And so forth. Such labels are particularly relevant for
    hieroglyphs that are hard to draw — like the “headstand guy” above,
    or my beloved derpy duck:</p>
    <div style="font-size:3rem">
    𓅷
    </div>
    <p>Oh wait, that’s a <em>duckling</em>, not a duck. Looks like a
    duck to me.</p>
    <div style="font-size:3rem">
    𓂓
    </div>
    <p>“Two arms upraised”?? Come on. That’s clearly a “field goal”.</p>
    <details>
    <summary>
    Clearly.
    </summary>
    <img style=margin:1em;height:140px src=images/referee-ka.png alt="A silly picture of an American football referee with his upraised arms replaced by the hieroglyph ka">
    </details>
    <p>Anyway. The point is that there are many ways one might refer to
    a hieroglyph.</p>
    <h2 id="but-why">But why?</h2>
    <p>One word: input. I want to be able to find a hieroglyph so I can
    input it. And I want to be able to use any one of many labels to
    narrow down the possibilities instead of searching visually. It’s
    true that this means several keystrokes per hieroglyph, potentially,
    but I still think it will be faster than mentally categorizing
    (sometimes repeatedly) and then searching visually.</p>
    <p>So let’s take this little input box. Let’s say we want to find
    the “headstand guy”. Now, obviously, if there is a headstand guy
    button, the problem is trivial:</p>
    <form id="search-1">
    <input value="" autocomplete="off" placeholder="Prepare to be amazed…" type="text" id="search-1-input">
    <label id="search-1-label">Click headstand guy:
    <button id="amaze">𓀡</button></label>
    </form>
    <script>
        const searchInput = document.querySelector('#search-1-input');
        const label = document.querySelector('#search-1-label');

        document.querySelector('#amaze').addEventListener('click', function() {
            searchInput.value = '𓀡';
            label.textContent = 'Okay not that amazing.';
        });

        // Prevent form submission
        document.querySelector('#search-1').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
            e.preventDefault()
        })
    </script>
    <style>
      #search-1 {
        display: grid;
        gap: 1em;
        padding: 1em;
        background: #efefef;
    }

    #amaze {
        background: white;
        justify-self: start;
    }
    </style>
    <p>What we need is a way to search for the headstand guy.</p>
