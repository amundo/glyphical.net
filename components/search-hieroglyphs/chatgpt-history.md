## You
i have a web component that searches a client-side database of hieroglyphic characters. the api for the search in my SearchHieroglyphs.js component looks like this:

```js
  search(query){
    let results = this.db.search(query)
    this.renderResults(query, results)
  }
```

I would like to use the history api (and i guess PushState?) to make such searches bookmarkable and available to the browser history. how can i do this?

To make the searches bookmarkable and available in the browser history, you can use the `History API` along with `PushState`. Here's an example of how you can modify your `SearchHieroglyphs` component to achieve this:

1. Update the search method to include the history manipulation code:

```javascript
search(query) {
  let results = this.db.search(query);
  this.renderResults(query, results);

  // Push the current search query to the browser history
  history.pushState({ query }, '', `?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`);
}

```

1. Add a new method called handlePopstate to handle the popstate event:

```javascript
handlePopstate(event) {
  if (event.state && event.state.query) {
    let query = event.state.query;
    let results = this.db.search(query);
    this.renderResults(query, results);
  }
}

```

1. Attach the handlePopstate method as an event listener to the popstate event:

```javascript
constructor() {
  // ...
  window.addEventListener('popstate', this.handlePopstate.bind(this));
}

```

1. Finally, modify your renderResults method to read the search query from the URL:

```javascript
renderResults(query, results) {
  // ...
  // Retrieve the search query from the URL parameters
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const searchQuery = urlParams.get('query');

  // Set the search query input value
  this.searchInput.value = searchQuery || '';
}

```

With these changes, when the user performs a search, the search query is pushed to the browser history using `pushState`. When the user clicks the browser's back/forward button, the `popstate` event is triggered, and the `handlePopstate` method is called to retrieve the search query from the state and perform the search again.

Note: Make sure to handle the initial load of the page as well, where you can check if there is a search query present in the URL and trigger the search accordingly.

Remember to update the necessary parts of the code to match your specific implementation.
