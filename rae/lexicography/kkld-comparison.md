# Proposal: Implementing a Sign Dictionary for Early-Stage Students of Egyptian, Inspired by the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary (KKLD)

## Introduction

The field of Egyptology is rife with complexities, particularly for beginners who must navigate the nuanced landscape of hieroglyphs and their meanings. One way to potentially ease this learning curve is to adopt a framework similar to the _Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary_ (KKLD) used for studying Japanese. This dictionary focuses on core meanings, typography to differentiate classes of readings, and employs a variety of lookup methods. By applying similar methods to ancient Egyptian, we can revolutionize the way early-stage students engage with Egyptology.

## The _Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary_ (KKLD)

The KKLD employs the following features that make it a beneficial tool for learners:

1. **Typography Differentiation**: Onyomi and Kunyomi readings are distinguished through different typography. For example, the Kanji 日 is read as `ニチ` (nichi) in the word `日本` (Japan) and `ひ` (hi) in the word `日` (day).
2. **Core Meanings**: Kanji signs are given core meanings (e.g., 日 is associated with SUN, DAY, JAPAN). These core meanings are highlighted in red for the 1000 most frequently used Kanji. 
3. **Frequent Signs Table**: A table of 1000 most frequent Kanji helps students prioritize their study.
4. **Important Variants**: Variants of Kanji are tabulated for easy lookup.
5. **SKIP Lookup**: A system that allows easy lookup of characters based on different parameters such as stroke, shape, or tags.

## Proposed Features for the Egyptian Sign Dictionary

### Core Meanings
A cornerstone feature should be the identification of core meanings for each hieroglyph, which can aid students in recognizing the most commonly used interpretations. These core meanings could be highlighted in red for the 1000 most frequently used signs.

### Typography Differentiation
Hieroglyphs can also have various readings, depending on their context. A system of typography differentiation would help students quickly distinguish these different uses. 

### Most Frequent Signs Table
Building a table that highlights the 1000 most frequent hieroglyphic signs can serve as a quick-reference guide. These signs' core meanings would be emphasized, similarly to how the KKLD operates.

### Important Variants Table
This table would include important variants of common hieroglyphs. This is particularly helpful for understanding how signs may have evolved or are used in various contexts.

### Lookup System
A lookup system analogous to the SKIP system could be created for hieroglyphs. This could be based on tags, shape, or complexity, making it easier for students to find the signs they are looking for.

## Benefits to Egyptology

1. **Streamlined Learning**: Provides a systematic approach to understanding a complex writing system.
2. **Prioritization**: Helps students focus on the most crucial and frequently used signs.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Aids in understanding the various readings of a single hieroglyph based on its use.
4. **Encourages Scholarly Activity**: A well-structured, easy-to-use dictionary can serve as a catalyst for more in-depth research and discussions within the field of Egyptology.

### Utility in Hieroglyph input

Hieroglyphs are far too complicated to type by “drawing” characters. Instead, we recommend designing an input method that allows users to “find” hieroglyphs by typing (and autocompleting) any of several possible labels for a given sign. 

### The quadrat layout challenge

The question of how hieroglyphs should be encoded with regard to the formation of _quadrats_ is a very complicated issue, and largely beyond the scope of this proposal. It is worth noting, however, that a “linear” encoding of hieroglyphs which essentially ignores quadrat layout is nonetheless a useful tool for interacting with Ancient Egyptian textual content. It should also be noted that the same linear sequence of hieroglyphs might have been “formatted” by two different scribes in two different ways — for me, this means that “layout” is mostly a matter of textual transcription rather than lexicography. 

## Conclusion
By adopting a framework similar to the KKLD, we can make strides in how Egyptology is taught and learned. This Egyptian Sign Dictionary would be a valuable resource for any student of ancient Egyptian culture and can pave the way for more nuanced and advanced studies in this fascinating field.
