LETTER TO THE SUPERIORS OF
THE MONASTERY OF SAINT PAUL
THE ANCHORITE
UPPER EGYPT, JEMLE, SEPTEMBIR 13, 698
Ink on papyrus
This papyrus provides rare historical documentation
of the early years of Islamic rule in Egypt. Transitions
can be slow, and the concerns of everyday people
during turbulent times were often mundane. The letter
concerns a donation offered by a monk named Moses
to the Monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite. The bulk
of Moses’s letter is written in Coptic, the vernacular
language of much of the Egyptian population in late
antiquity. The text also opens with an invocation to God
in Greek and Arabic, and names the governor of Egypt
at that time, Abd al-Aziz, in Arabic.
