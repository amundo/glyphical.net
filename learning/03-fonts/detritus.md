People tend to think of PDFs as the gold standard of font technology, but the web is actually the most important platform for fonts today. And not only that, it’s the most advanced platform for fonts.



To understand what a font is, we need some terminology. 

* **Font**: A font is a collection of characters, each of which is represented by a glyph. A font is a set of glyphs that share a common design.
* **Typeface**: A typeface is a set of fonts that share a common design. For instance, the typeface “Times New Roman” includes the fonts “Times New Roman Regular,” “Times New Roman Bold,” “Times New Roman Italic,” and “Times New Roman Bold Italic.”
* **Glyph**: A glyph is a visual representation of a character. For instance, the letter “A” is a character, and the letter “A” in Times New Roman is a glyph. Here are two different glyphs for the letter “A”: <span style="font-family:fantasy">A</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">A</span>. Same letter, different glyphs (from different fonts.)

These days, most people encounter fonts in the context of a word processing application like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Here, for instance, are screencaptures of how you choose a font in Google Docs and Microsoft Word:

This seems simple enough: select some text, use the drop-down to choose a font, and the text changes to that font. But what’s actually happening, behind the scenes? What if you want to use a font that’s not in Google Doc’s list?
