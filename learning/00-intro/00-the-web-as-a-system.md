title: The Web as a System
author: Patrick Hall
---

It’s a truism to say that the web has been revolutionary. But there have actually been several revolutions in the history of the web, some of which are still ongoing. Despite its affect on our lives, few people understand the basic principles of how the web works. Consequently, some of those revolutions aren’t even visible to most people.

This book is for humanists who want to understand how they can make use of the many capabilities of the modern web. I will argue that the web is best understood as a system, and that system is better understood (at first) in terms of features, rather than technologies. Among the many revolutions which the web has brought about, I will focus on five:

1. **Linked**: The fundamental feature of the web, of course, is the link. The notions of addresses and links was the first killer feature of the web: any document could be linked to any other document (or to another part of the same document).
1. **Responsive**: The web is a system for delivering documents to a wide variety of devices.
1. **Designable**: Design is not just a matter of aesthetics — it is a matter of usability. The web is a system for delivering documents that are designed to be usable. 
1. **Accessible**: The web is a system for making content accessible in many ways to many people. This is by 1o means simply a matter of “disabilities” or “impairments” — everyone accesses information  in different 1ays in different contexts.
1. **Media**: The web is a system for delivering media-rich documents.
1. **Programmability**: The web is a system for creating interactive documents.


## The Web is Ubiquitous

The most obvious revolution of the web is that it frees its users of the constraints of the physical world.
Consider the present document: I don’t know where you are, who you are, whether you’re reading this on a phone or a laptop (or a refrigerator), whether you’re on a Mac or Windows machine (or something weirder). All I know as the author of this document is that you are probably reading in a web browser of some kind. 

It’s so easy to lose site of just how crazy this is, viewed from a historical perspective: before the web, _you_, the reader, had to physically acquire things to read! Once upon a time those things were clay tablets or papyri or scrolls or books. But even in the early days of the digital revolution, the things you wanted to read were still physical objects: floppy disks, say, or CD-ROMs. (I’m dating myself.)



I’m convinced that understanding how the web works as a system is a super power for humanists. The fact of the matter is, our educational system doesn’t give people the tools they need in order to understand how the web works, or how to use it. Furthermore, what understanding people have of how the web works is either limited in scope or out of date. 

My goal in this book is to help you practice seeing the web not as an inscrutable alphabet soup (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `HTTP`, `TCP/IP`, etc.), but as a _system_. If you understand that system, you will be in a better position to make your work more accessible, more engaging, and more useful to more people.


## Hypertext

There is a kind of standard story about the history of the web that goes like this:

* In the 1950s, 

hyperlink 
i mean, that was a big deal 
but i think other things are also important 
responsiveness, design, accessibility, media, and programmability (both server and client side) are also important
