i was reading this article 

https://www.cnbc.com/id/44642508

about business insider
(I rather like some elements of their design so was digging around) 

and i ran across this bit:

    Great Technology. The back-end technology at Business Insider is leaps and bounds better than any I’ve seen — perhaps apart from Gawker. The content system makes it super easy to put together posts, add images, and make changes. The editors are constantly experimenting with headlines and images, trying to see what will get a reader’s attention.

    I sat down at the desk next to Nicholas Carlson while he was adjusting the layout of Business Insider’s technology page, Silicon Alley Insider. It’s incredibly simple to swap stories and change the format of the pages on Business Insider. No complicated codes to remember.

    All WYSIWYG.

I found it interesting that in a kind of “popular press” article, addressed to normies, there is a comment on how WYSIWYG is better. I mean, in some way s it is 
nd I find myself thiinking about my "folder full of files" attitude
which is obviously very lofi 
but i have this urge and have had for a long time that academics should understand the basics of how such a folder can be part of the web 
but if this normie guy is advocating wysiwyg, then why should i imagine that academics would want to know anything about “complicated codes”
I think I could make an argument 
 

    Science is not (or should not be) in the ads ecosystem — Sites with ads are complicated. They require included material to be transcluded, which presumes a server-side system at the very least
    SEO and stuff like that — In principle science shouldn’t be striving to “attract” anything — it should be striving to explain
    All WYSIWYG systems support a subset of the web platform — No matter how easy a system is, WYSIWYG is going to break down at some point, unless you have limitless development budget (maybe a business like Business Insider does) to enable new widgets or “blocks” or whatever
    WYSIWYG is not portable — It’s built into a system, like Business Insider’s Wordpress or whatever CMS they use. Academia exists on a shoestring, and domains can die. A project should be able to migrate their content to another system, and that means assuming the least common denominator (in my opinion HTTP(S) is a reasonable baseline)
