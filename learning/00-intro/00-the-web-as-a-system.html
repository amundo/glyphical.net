<h1 class="title">The Web as a System</h1>
<p class="author">Patrick Hall</p>
</header>
<p>It’s a truism to say that the web has been revolutionary. But there
have actually been several revolutions in the history of the web, some
of which are still ongoing. Despite its affect on our lives, few people
understand the basic principles of how the web works. Consequently, some
of those revolutions aren’t even visible to most people.</p>
<p>This book is for humanists who want to understand how they can make
use of the many capabilities of the modern web. I will argue that the
web is best understood as a system, and that system is better understood
(at first) in terms of features, rather than technologies. Among the
many revolutions which the web has brought about, I will focus on
five:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Linked</strong>: The fundamental feature of the web, of
course, is the link. The notions of addresses and links was the first
killer feature of the web: any document could be linked to any other
document (or to another part of the same document).</li>
<li><strong>Responsive</strong>: The web is a system for delivering
documents to a wide variety of devices.</li>
<li><strong>Designable</strong>: Design is not just a matter of
aesthetics — it is a matter of usability. The web is a system for
delivering documents that are designed to be usable.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible</strong>: The web is a system for making content
accessible in many ways to many people. This is by 1o means simply a
matter of “disabilities” or “impairments” — everyone accesses
information in different 1ays in different contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong>: The web is a system for delivering
media-rich documents.</li>
<li><strong>Programmability</strong>: The web is a system for creating
interactive documents.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-web-is-ubiquitous">The Web is Ubiquitous</h2>
<p>The most obvious revolution of the web is that it frees its users of
the constraints of the physical world. Consider the present document: I
don’t know where you are, who you are, whether you’re reading this on a
phone or a laptop (or a refrigerator), whether you’re on a Mac or
Windows machine (or something weirder). All I know as the author of this
document is that you are probably reading in a web browser of some
kind.</p>
<p>It’s so easy to lose site of just how crazy this is, viewed from a
historical perspective: before the web, <em>you</em>, the reader, had to
physically acquire things to read! Once upon a time those things were
clay tablets or papyri or scrolls or books. But even in the early days
of the digital revolution, the things you wanted to read were still
physical objects: floppy disks, say, or CD-ROMs. (I’m dating
myself.)</p>
<p>I’m convinced that understanding how the web works as a system is a
super power for humanists. The fact of the matter is, our educational
system doesn’t give people the tools they need in order to understand
how the web works, or how to use it. Furthermore, what understanding
people have of how the web works is either limited in scope or out of
date.</p>
<p>My goal in this book is to help you practice seeing the web not as an
inscrutable alphabet soup (<code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>,
<code>JavaScript</code>, <code>HTTP</code>, <code>TCP/IP</code>, etc.),
but as a <em>system</em>. If you understand that system, you will be in
a better position to make your work more accessible, more engaging, and
more useful to more people.</p>
<h2 id="hypertext">Hypertext</h2>
<p>There is a kind of standard story about the history of the web that
goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1950s,</li>
</ul>
<p>hyperlink i mean, that was a big deal but i think other things are
also important responsiveness, design, accessibility, media, and
programmability (both server and client side) are also important</p>
