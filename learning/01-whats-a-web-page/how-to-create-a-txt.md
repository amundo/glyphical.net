## Opening a .txt File in Your Default Browser

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for creating a .txt file containing a word list, saving it to your desktop, and then opening it in your default web browser across different operating systems.


## For Windows Users

### Create a .txt File and Save It to the Desktop
1. Right-click on an empty space on your Desktop.
2. Go to `New` > `Text Document`.
3. Open the new text document, paste your word list into it.
4. Go to `File` > `Save As`, choose `Text Documents (*.txt)` as the type, name your file, and ensure it is being saved on the Desktop. Click `Save`.

### Open the .txt File in Your Default Browser
1. Locate the `.txt` file on your Desktop.
2. Right-click the file and select `Open with` > `Choose another app`.
3. Select your preferred web browser from the list and check the box that says `Always use this app to open .txt files` if you want all `.txt` files to open in the browser by default. Click `OK`.



## For Linux Users

### Create a .txt File and Save It to the Desktop
1. Open your preferred text editor (e.g., `Gedit`, `Nano`, `Vim`).
2. Paste your word list into the text editor.
3. Save the file by going to `File` > `Save` (or using the command line, e.g., `:w` in Vim), name your file ensuring it ends with `.txt`, and save it to your Desktop directory (usually `/home/yourusername/Desktop`).

### Open the .txt File in Your Default Browser
1. Navigate to your Desktop directory in your file manager or through the terminal.
2. Right-click the `.txt` file and select `Open With` followed by your preferred web browser. If using the terminal, you can open the file directly with a command like `firefox filename.txt` or `google-chrome filename.txt`, replacing `filename.txt` with the name of your file.


## For Mac Users

### Create a .txt File and Save It to the Desktop
1. Open `TextEdit` from your Applications folder.
2. If `TextEdit` opens a previous document, go to `File` > `New` to create a new document.
3. Before pasting your word list, go to `Format` > `Make Plain Text` to switch the document to plain text format.
4. Paste your word list into the document.
5. Save the document by going to `File` > `Save`. In the save dialog, name your file ensuring it ends with `.txt`, select `Desktop` as the location, and click `Save`.

### Open the .txt File in Your Default Browser
1. Locate the `.txt` file on your Desktop.
2. Right-click (or Ctrl-click) the file and select `Open With`. Then choose your preferred web browser from the list of applications. If your browser isn't listed, you'll need to select `Other` and navigate to your browser in the Applications folder.
