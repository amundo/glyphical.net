# Creating an HTML File on Mac, Linux, and Windows

This tutorial provides instructions for creating a basic HTML file on different operating systems. The process is largely the same across platforms, but this guide will ensure you know how to create and save your HTML file correctly no matter what computer you're using.

## Common Steps for All Platforms

1. **Start with a Text Editor**: Open your preferred text editor. On Mac, you might use `TextEdit`. On Linux, options include `Gedit`, `Nano`, or `Vim`. On Windows, `Notepad` is a simple choice.
2. **Write Your HTML**: Start typing your HTML content. Here's a simple example to get you started:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My First HTML Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. **Save Your File**: Save your document with a `.html` extension, such as `my-first-page.html`. Ensure you select the correct file type if your text editor presents options.

## Platform-Specific Tips

### For Mac Users
- In `TextEdit`, switch to plain text mode before you begin by going to `Format` > `Make Plain Text`.
- When saving, if `.txt` is added automatically, remove it, ensuring the filename ends with `.html`.

### For Linux Users
- If using a GUI-based text editor like `Gedit`, simply save the file with the `.html` extension.
- For terminal-based editors, when you save, include the `.html` extension explicitly in the filename.

### For Windows Users
- In `Notepad`, when saving your file, select `All Files (*.*)` from the `Save as type` dropdown menu and ensure the filename ends with `.html`.

## Opening Your HTML File
Once saved, you can open your HTML file in any web browser to view your work. Simply right-click the file and choose `Open with`, then select your preferred browser.
