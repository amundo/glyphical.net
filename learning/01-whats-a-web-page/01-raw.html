<p>Greetings earthlings, we just opened this channel as a place to talk
about technical skills as they relate to Egyptology. The thought was
that whereas other the other tech channels like
⁠resources-and-reference-material , ⁠unicode-and-fonts and ⁠accessibility
are specific to particular topics, this one would be more more
specifically about learning. The more knowledge there is in the
community, the more likely it is that digital content can exist that its
truly open and reusable. 👍 👍</p>

<p>ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/13/2024 8:22 AM</p>
<p>For some reason I am obsessed with the idea that more people should
be empowered to use web technology to do stuff. and as a guy who spent
most of his life in (documentary) linguistics, the stuff I always found
myself working was stuff related, mostly, to documentation and
revitalization. So stuff like building dictionaries, learning tools,
interactive text interfaces, stuff like that.</p>
<p>ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/13/2024 8:37 AM</p>
<p>I’ve also been a web guy forever, so naturally all the stuff I built
was on the web. But here’s the thing: it’s not obvious what “on the web”
means. There are many things that you might say are “on the web”, but
the way that they are actually on the web and the ways that they get
there can vary wildly.</p>
<p>[8:38 AM]</p>
<p>I would like to share some particular approaches to using the web
that I think are simple but still powerful. I might be shouting into the
wind, but I hope not! ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/13/2024 8:49 AM</p>
<p>Put briefly: a little understanding can go a long, long way, but the
amount of information out there is so overwhelming that it can be hard
to wade through and find the directly applicable stuff. I’m going to try
to help with that. nufegood nufegood</p>

<p>ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/13/2024 10:39 AM</p>
<p>If anyone has ideas for specific small projects they’d like to work
on, ideas are welcome. I’m planning to start with basics of what a web
page is and how to create and view one. I’ll use examples from Coptic
and Egyptian, again, alternate content would be welcome as well.</p>
<p>[10:41 AM]</p>
<p>Also, if anyone would actually like to put something on the web, we
can do that — either by hosting them on github, on your own site if you
have one, or you are welcome to take a corner of glyphical.net, my own
site (assuming the content is on topic of course!)</p>

<p>Wow cool, ambitious! Grammar checking is a tough one ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/13/2024
5:19 PM</p>
<p>Getting something to run in iOS and Android as an app is a real
challenge too, from what I understand (haven’t done it myself, I stick
to web stuff) (edited) ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/14/2024 1:02 PM 🕸️ Let’s learn about what
a web page is</p>
<p>(edited)</p>
<p>[1:03 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ I’ll start every comment in this topic with this emoji. (it’s a
web, get it?) 🕷️ 🕷️</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>[1:05 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ The modern web has become kind of opaque. The workflows people use
to access information often involve apps, which are different from the
web — they apps of the kind that you download from an app store are
designed run on phones, and they are great for that purpose — they are
simple, easy to use, and have advanced interactions like smooth
animation.</p>
<p>[1:05 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ Will the web be replaced by these apps? Nope. The web has some
killer features that make it more maintainable, cheaper, and more
accessible to users, including users on mobile devices. (edited) ⲡⲁⲧ—
02/14/2024 1:15 PM</p>
<p>🕸️ The web’s universality is a killer feature. I want to show you how
to break the ice of creating a web page if you have never done it
before. I believe this is a skill that many people around here could
benefit from, because a lot of the work that is done in this community
(even as comments in discord) are totally worthy of being shared and
saved on the web.</p>
<p>[1:16 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ So if you have fifteen minutes, I will give you the steps today to
create a simple HTML file that contains a sample list of Coptic words
with translations. 😮 😮</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>[1:21 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ First, we need some content. I’m going to use the first few
chapters of Lambin vocab, brb… ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/14/2024 2:12 PM</p>
<p>🕸️ Okay, here’s the short list we will use to create our first page:
ⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ ‘water’ ⲡⲏⲓ ‘house’ ⲡⲣⲁⲛ ‘name’ ⲧⲣ̅ⲣⲱ ‘queen’ ϩⲁ ‘under’ ⲡⲱⲛⲉ
‘stone’ ⲡϩⲁⲓ ‘husband’ ⲡⲛⲟⲩⲃ ‘gold’ ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ‘mother’ ⲁⲛ ‘not’ ⲡⲁⲧ—
02/14/2024 2:35 PM</p>
<p>🕸️ What we will do first is create a plain text file with this
content. If you’re not familiar with creating a [plain .txt
file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text “plain .txt file</p>
<p>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)“){.anchor_c8ddc0
.anchorUnderlineOnHover__78236 rel=“noreferrer noopener” target=“_blank”
role=“button” tabindex=“0”}, then here’s instructions (partially
ChatGPT’d, I admit) with instructions: [Creating a text file on
Windows/Mac/Linux](https://glyphical.net/learning/01-whats-a-web-page/html/how-to-create-an-html-file.html
“Creating a text file on Windows/Mac/Linux</p>

.anchorUnderlineOnHover__78236 rel=“noreferrer noopener” target=“_blank”
role=“button” tabindex=“0”} ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/14/2024 2:42 PM</p>
<p>🕸️ Here’s what I get when I open the file in my browser. Take a look
at the URL in the address bar, it’s a bit weird:
file:///Users/me/sample-words.txt First off, most URLs do not start with
file, they start with http or https. This is because opening a file in
the way we have here (Right click &gt; Open with…) opens the file from
the file system in the same way you might with a word processing program
like Word, or any other desktop application. This matters a lot, as it
turns out, but we will come back to this issue. For now, opening files
this way is enough to mess let us mess around with a web page. Which we
will now do.</p>
<p>Image Image</p>
<p>[2:43 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ Here’s an important fact: ## HTML files are just text files that
have .html instead of .txt as their file suffix</p>
<p>[2:45 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ Proof: go to the directory where your sample-words.txt file is
saved, and dupilicate it. (On Mac that will result in a file called
sample-words copy.txt. Rename that file to sample-words.html. Now open
that in the browser just like you did before.</p>
<p>[2:47 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ Note that there might be some weirdness when you change the file
suffix. A Mac, for instance, throws the message above. The default
application for a .txt file is a text editor, whereas the default
application for an .html file is whatever your default browser is. It’s
find to say Use .html here. Then double-click the resulting file, or
else use Right click -&gt; Open with… and choose a browser. (Same
difference.)</p>
<p>Image Image</p>
<p>ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/14/2024 2:53 PM</p>
<p>🕸️ Okay, now what? Well, you will see one of two things, depending on
some rather mysterious variables. One possibility is that you will see
something like the image on the left, where all the Coptic words and
definitions have been merged onto a single line, but they look okay.
(More on that wrapping in a second.) The more crazy 🤯 result is the one
on the right, which I got when I opened the file with Safari instead of
Firefox. WTF. This, my friends, is to do with Unicode. If you’re a
language nerd learning web stuff, you have to think about Unicode right
away. A lot of web tutorials out there might not help you with this, so
we’re going to make sure we get it right. (edited)</p>
<p>Image Image</p>
<p>Image Image</p>
<p>[2:57 PM]</p>
<p>🕸️ What’s happening here is that one the browsers (Safari) isn’t
configured to use Unicode by default. It might be the case that I could
go into the preferences and tell Safari to always assume Unicode, but
that would only solve the problem for me — ultimately we’re going to
want to put this stuff on the web, and we hardly want to ask users to go
fiddling with browser settings in order to see a few words in Coptic!
The bottom line here is that we can modify our HTML file
(sample-words.html) to tell the browser “Hey, browser! This file is in
Unicode! Interpret it as such!” ✅ ✅</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>[3:00 PM] 🕸️ It’s worth pausing here to reflect on what’s going
on:</p>
<pre><code>The browser reads the contents of a file (usually an .html file)
The browser processes that content and then displays it</code></pre>
<p>It’s step 2 that matters. Many magical things go on in step 2,
magical things that can give you magical superpowers that can help you
to create magical things and share them with the world. For the last
couple of steps today, we’re going to:</p>
<pre><code>Fix our HTML file (it’s not valid right now!)
Fix it so we’re sure our browser interprets our file as Unicode.</code></pre>
<p>ⲡⲁⲧ— 02/14/2024 3:12 PM</p>
<p>🕸️ So as we have seen, an HTML file is just a .txt file with an .html
suffix. But that’s not all there is to it: the contents of an HTML file
must also obey the rules of how an HTML file should be written. HTML is
a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language
“markup language</p>
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)“){.anchor_c8ddc0
.anchorUnderlineOnHover__78236 rel=“noreferrer noopener” target=“_blank”
role=“button” tabindex=“0”}, which means that it contains not only text
content, but also “meta” content that tells the browser how to interpret
the various bits of content and to treat them specially. HTML, as I’m
sure you know, uses <tag>s to mark up content. In fact, the entirely to
an HTML file is wrapped in a tag called, astonishingly enough,
<html>
. Note that
<html>
is called an “opening” tag, and it has a matching “closing” tag:
</html>
<p>: ### sample-words-2.html</p>
<html>
ⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ ‘water’ ⲡⲏⲓ ‘house’ ⲡⲣⲁⲛ ‘name’ ⲧⲣ̅ⲣⲱ ‘queen’ ϩⲁ ‘under’ ⲡⲱⲛⲉ
‘stone’ ⲡϩⲁⲓ ‘husband’ ⲡⲛⲟⲩⲃ ‘gold’ ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ‘mother’ ⲁⲛ ‘not’
</html>

<p>::: {#message-content-1207421775563202680 .markup_a7e664
.messageContent__21e69} 🕸️ We still haven’t fixed our problem in Safari.
And in fact, adding that tag didn’t seem to do much at all. Let’s fix
that now. In fact, for an HTML file to be valid, it needs a bit more
structure.</p>
<pre><code>A &lt;!doctype html&gt; This always has to be the first line in an HTML file. Note the weird !, the fact that there are two words in there, doctype and html, and the fact that it doesn’t have a matching closing tag. Of course the first tag is going to be weird. 😑
&lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags. If you leave these out, the browser will figure it out, but you shuoldn&#39;t, because it’s a useful way to distinguish document metadata and the content of the page itself. Basically, anything which is inside the &lt;body&gt; tag is what the browser will display to the user.
A &lt;title&gt; - The title is what shows up in the tab (which will otherwise show the document’s URL). It goes inside the &lt;head&gt; tag.
&lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt; Oh boy. This one’s weird. Like &lt;title&gt;, it goes inside the &lt;head&gt; tag. (Another weirdo tag which doesn’t have a matching close tag.) Believe it or not, this thing means that the page is in Unicode. This will fix the Safari problem above.</code></pre>
<p>So there you go, a workable starting point for creating valid HTML
pages. Here’s the whole thing that you can try: &lt;!doctype
html&gt;</p>
<p>ⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ ‘water’ ⲡⲏⲓ ‘house’ ⲡⲣⲁⲛ ‘name’ ⲧⲣ̅ⲣⲱ ‘queen’ ϩⲁ ‘under’ ⲡⲱⲛⲉ
‘stone’ ⲡϩⲁⲓ ‘husband’ ⲡⲛⲟⲩⲃ ‘gold’ ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ‘mother’ ⲁⲛ ‘not’</p>

<p>[3:25 PM]</p>
🕸️ Finally! We have made an HTML page, and that problem in Safari has
gone away thanks to our weird “charset meta tag” declaration
<meta charset=utf-8>
. Notice the
<title>
<p>is showing up in the tab instead of the URL. Other than that, it
still sucks as a web page because nothing is formatted! But this is a
huge first step. Tune in next time for, uh, more stuff.</p>
