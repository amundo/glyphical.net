			<p class="indented">25.1 The relative, imperfect, circumstantial, and second tense converters may be used with the First Perfect, the First Future, existential and possessive predications, and copulative sentences with <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲉ</span>. The relative forms for all of these have already been discussed. The second tense of the First Perfect, i.e. the Second Perfect, was introduced in Lesson 14. The second tense forms of existential, possessive, and copulative sentences are too rare for inclusion here.</p>

					<p>The imperfect of the First Perfect (<span class="c">ⲛⲉ-ⲁϥⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</span>) corresponds to the English pluperfect: he had heard, he had written. The circumstantial of the First Perfect is used to describe an action as completed prior to the tense of the verb in the main clause.</p>

					<p>This form is commonly called the <em>imperfectum futuri</em>. The Second Future (<span class="c">ⲉϥⲛⲁⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</span>) has all the normal uses of a second tense form. Special uses of both these conjugations will be mentioned later on.</p>
					<p class="indented">The First Future and its related system are formally an off-shoot of the Present System, with <span class="c">ⲛⲁ-</span> inserted before the infinitive. It has no other characteristics of the Bipartite Conjugation, however: (1) it is not durative (except with certain aspectually neutral verbs, e.g. <span class="c">ⲣⲁϣⲉ</span>); (2) only the Infinitive may occur in predicate position; (3) the prenominal and prepronominal forms of the Infinitive occur freely.</p>

			<p><span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲅ-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛ̅ϥ-</span>, and <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲥ-</span> also appear frequently as <span class="c">ⲛⲅ̅-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛϥ̅-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲥ̅-</span>. The conjunctive is used to continue the force of a preceding verbal prefix. In a sense, it is no more than an inflected form of the conjunction "and". It is especially frequent after a First Future or an Imperative:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ϯⲛⲁⲃⲱⲕ ⲛ̅ⲧⲁϣⲁϫⲉ ⲛⲙ̅ⲙⲁϥ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I shall go and speak with him.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ϩⲙⲟⲟⲥ ⲛ̅ⲅⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅ ⲉ ⲧⲁⲥⲃⲱ.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Sit down and listen to my teaching.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁⲛⲓ-ⲛ̅ϫⲱⲱⲙⲉ ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲧⲛ̅ⲧⲁⲁⲩ ⲛⲁϥ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bring the books and give them to him.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>It may be used to continue the force of virtually any preceding verbal prefix except that of the affirmative First Perfect, but even this restriction does not hold in the relative forms. It is also used after an Inflected Infinitive, as in</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ϩⲁⲡⲥ̅ ⲉⲣⲟⲛ ⲉⲧⲣⲉⲛⲃⲱⲕ ⲛ̅ⲧⲛ̅ϣⲁϫⲉ ⲛⲙ̅ⲙⲁϥ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>It is necessary that we go and speak with him.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>In many instances, especially where there is a change of subject, the Conjunctive clause has the meaning of a purpose or result clause:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁⲛⲓϥ ⲉⲣⲟⲓ ⲛ̅ⲧⲁⲛⲁⲩ ⲉⲣⲟϥ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bring him to me so that I may see him.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲙⲁ ⲛⲁⲩ ⲛ̅ⲥⲉⲟⲩⲱⲙ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Give them (food) so that they may eat.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>This usage depends very much on the presence of an injunctive (imperative) force, implicit or explicit, in the first clause. For the conjunctive with Greek conjunctions, see Lesson 30.</p>
			<p class="indented">The Conjunctive resembles the Tripartite Conjugation: only the Infinitive may be used as its verbal component. Negation is with <span class="c">-ⲧⲙ̅-</span> before the Infinitive. If the Conjunctive continues a negative verb, however, the negation may carry over.</p>

					<td>There was someone in Egypt who had a paralyzed son. And he brought him and set him in the cell of Apa Makarios, and he left him weeping near the door, and he went to a distance. The monk looked and saw the little boy weeping, and he said to him, "Who brought you here?" And he said, "It was my father. He brought me, he cast me away, and he went." The monk said to him, "Get up and run and catch up to him." And immediately, he became well, and he arose, he caught up to his father, and in this way they went to their house rejoicing.</td>
