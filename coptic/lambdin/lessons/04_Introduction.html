        The political unification of Egypt took place around the beginning of
        the third millennium B.C. with the establishment of the First Dynasty at
        Memphis. Soon afterward written records began to appear in the
        hieroglyphic script, which together with its cursive derivatives,
        hieratic and demotic, remained the sole medium for writing the Egyptian
        language until the end of the second century A.D. At that time, the
        missionaries of the Church, then centered in Alexandria, undertook the
        translation of the Bible from Greek into Egyptian in order to facilitate
        their task of Christianizing the country. They abandoned the
        three-thousand-year-old hieroglyphic writing system, probably as much
        because of its complexity and imperfections as for its "heathen"
        associations, and chose instead to employ a modified form of the Greek
        alphabet. Egyptian in this new guise is known as Coptic, a modern term
        derived from Arabic <em>qubṭî</em>, itself a corruption of the Greek
        word <em>(ai)gúpti(os)</em>, Egyptian.

        The conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. and the
        subsequent Greek-speaking administration of the country under the
        Ptolemies led to the thorough Hellenization of Lower (i.e. Northern)
        Egypt. Egyptian-Greek bilingualism was apparently commonplace in the
        Delta, and it is probable that much Greek technical, legal, and
        commercial terminology was introduced into spoken Egyptian at this time.
        Rough and unsystematic attempts to transcribe Egyptian in the Greek
        alphabet were made as early as the third century B.C. It was only
        natural, then, that the Coptic translators of the Bible not only adopted
        the Greek alphabet but also generously supplemented the native lexicon
        with many more borrowings from Greek. The Greek vocabulary of any Coptic
        text is significantly large.

      <p>
        Evidence of dialectal differences is found as early as the third
        millenium B.C., but the general conservatism of the hieroglyphic script
        and the practice of standardizing a particular form of the language for
        long periods of time (e.g. Middle Egyptian, New Egyptian) tend to
        obscure the great dialectal diversity that must have existed in the
        spoken language as one traveled the 750 miles down the Nile from Aswan
        to the Mediterranean. The individual dialects first become recognizable
        when we reach the Coptic period and see the language spelled out in the
        Greek alphabet. The exact geographical location of the dialects is still
        a matter of scholarly debate, but the reader should become familiar with
        their names and the approximate chronological range of their use for
        literary purposes.

        Sahidic, the dialect treated in this book, was the dialect chosen for
        the official translation of the Bible mentioned above. There is
        conflicting evidence on its geographical location: the name Sahidic,
        from Arabic <em>aṣ-ṣaʿîd</em>, Upper (i.e. Southern) Egypt, places it in
        the south (hence its alternate name: Theban, Thebaic); linguistic
        considerations, however, favor a northern locale, in the neighborhood of
        Memphis and the eastern Delta. One cannot rule out the possibility that
        both locations are correct; the fact that Thebes and Memphis alternated
        as the capital of Egypt through much of its history and were the chief
        centers of religious (priestly), building, and commercial activity could
        have led to the development of an "urban" dialect in these two areas,
        quite distinct from the dialects of the "rural" areas that lay between.
        By the fourth century A.D. Sahidic was firmly established as the
        standard literary dialect and retained this status until its demise
        around the tenth century. Surviving texts in Sahidic include, in
        addition to the New Testament and a large portion of the Old, a
        considerable corpus of Church literature and some remnants of secular
        literature, nearly all of which is translated from Greek. Of native
        works we have only the writings of Pachomius (c. 300), the founder of
        Egyptian monasticism; Shenute (c. 400), the administrator of the White
        Monastery in Upper Egypt; and Besa, a disciple of Shenute. The Coptic
        writings of Shenute, who attempted to mould the language into a literary
        vehicle comparable to Greek, are often referred to as the "classics" of
        Sahidic literature. Their syntactic complexity and unusual vocabulary
        usage, however, place them beyond the scope of the present work, which
        is based on the language of the more widely studied translation
        literature.

        Bohairic replaced Sahidic as the standard literary dialect. Bohairic
        texts are attested as early as the ninth century, but the dialect does
        not seem to have achieved wide usage until it was adopted as the
        official language of the Coptic Church in the eleventh century. Most
        Bohairic texts come from after this time, and many of them were
        translated from Sahidic originals. The term Bohairic comes from Arabic
        <em>al-buhairah</em>, Lower (i.e. Northern) Egypt; it is generally
        assumed that Bohairic was the dialect of the Western Delta, including
        Alexandria and Nitria. The designation Memphitic has also been used for
        this dialect.

      <p>
        Fayyumic, as its name implies, was the dialect of northern Middle Egypt
        in the vicinity of the Fayyum Basin. It is well attested in texts
        ranging from the fourth to the eleventh century, but it apparently never
        attained the status of Sahidic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achmimic, generally located in the area of Akhmim (Panopolis) in
        southern Middle Egypt, enjoyed only a brief literary period from the
        third to the fifth century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subachmimic, tentatively localized between Akhmim and Thebes, was used
        extensively in the fourth and fifth centuries for the translation of
        Manichaean and Gnostic literature. Its association with this heretical
        material probably had much to do with its early demise as a literary
        dialect. The Nag Hammadi texts are in Subachmimic or a variety of
        Sahidic influenced by Subachmimic in varying degrees.
      </p>

        For further details on the dialects the reader should consult the works
        of Worrell, Vergote, Kahle, and Till cited in the Bibliography.

        The Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 A.D. and the subsequent suppression of
        the native Christian population resulted in the gradual dying out of the
        Egyptian language in favor of Arabic. We cannot be sure how long this
        process took, but it is safe to assume that by the fifteenth century
        Coptic had ceased to be a native spoken language, thus bringing to an
        end a continuous written record of over four thousand years.
