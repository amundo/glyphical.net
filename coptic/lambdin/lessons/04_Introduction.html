			<p>The political unification of Egypt took place around the beginning of the third millennium B.C. with the establishment of the First Dynasty at Memphis. Soon afterward written records began to appear in the hieroglyphic script, which together with its cursive derivatives, hieratic and demotic, remained the sole medium for writing the Egyptian language until the end of the second century A.D. At that time, the missionaries of the Church, then centered in Alexandria, undertook the translation of the Bible from Greek into Egyptian in order to facilitate their task of Christianizing the country. They abandoned the three-thousand-year-old hieroglyphic writing system, probably as much because of its complexity and imperfections as for its "heathen" associations, and chose instead to employ a modified form of the Greek alphabet. Egyptian in this new guise is known as Coptic, a modern term derived from Arabic <em>qubṭî</em>, itself a corruption of the Greek word <em>(ai)gúpti(os)</em>, Egyptian.</p>
			<p>The conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. and the subsequent Greek-speaking administration of the country under the Ptolemies led to the thorough Hellenization of Lower (i.e. Northern) Egypt. Egyptian-Greek bilingualism was apparently commonplace in the Delta, and it is probable that much Greek technical, legal, and commercial terminology was introduced into spoken Egyptian at this time. Rough and unsystematic attempts to transcribe Egyptian in the Greek alphabet were made as early as the third century B.C. It was only natural, then, that the Coptic translators of the Bible not only adopted the Greek alphabet but also generously supplemented the native lexicon with many more borrowings from Greek. The Greek vocabulary of any Coptic text is significantly large.</p>
			<p>Evidence of dialectal differences is found as early as the third millenium B.C., but the general conservatism of the hieroglyphic script and the practice of standardizing a particular form of the language for long periods of time (e.g. Middle Egyptian, New Egyptian) tend to obscure the great dialectal diversity that must have existed in the spoken language as one traveled the 750 miles down the Nile from Aswan to the Mediterranean. The individual dialects first become recognizable when we reach the Coptic period and see the language spelled out in the Greek alphabet. The exact geographical location of the dialects is still a matter of scholarly debate, but the reader should become familiar with their names and the approximate chronological range of their use for literary purposes.</p>
			<p>Sahidic, the dialect treated in this book, was the dialect chosen for the official translation of the Bible mentioned above. There is conflicting evidence on its geographical location: the name Sahidic, from Arabic <em>aṣ-ṣaʿîd</em>, Upper (i.e. Southern) Egypt, places it in the south (hence its alternate name: Theban, Thebaic); linguistic considerations, however, favor a northern locale, in the neighborhood of Memphis and the eastern Delta. One cannot rule out the possibility that both locations are correct; the fact that Thebes and Memphis alternated as the capital of Egypt through much of its history and were the chief centers of religious (priestly), building, and commercial activity could have led to the development of an "urban" dialect in these two areas, quite distinct from the dialects of the "rural" areas that lay between. By the fourth century A.D. Sahidic was firmly established as the standard literary dialect and retained this status until its demise around the tenth century. Surviving texts in Sahidic include, in addition to the New Testament and a large portion of the Old, a considerable corpus of Church literature and some remnants of secular literature, nearly all of which is translated from Greek. Of native works we have only the writings of Pachomius (c. 300), the founder of Egyptian monasticism; Shenute (c. 400), the administrator of the White Monastery in Upper Egypt; and Besa, a disciple of Shenute. The Coptic writings of Shenute, who attempted to mould the language into a literary vehicle comparable to Greek, are often referred to as the "classics" of Sahidic literature. Their syntactic complexity and unusual vocabulary usage, however, place them beyond the scope of the present work, which is based on the language of the more widely studied translation literature.</p>
			<p>Bohairic replaced Sahidic as the standard literary dialect. Bohairic texts are attested as early as the ninth century, but the dialect does not seem to have achieved wide usage until it was adopted as the official language of the Coptic Church in the eleventh century. Most Bohairic texts come from after this time, and many of them were translated from Sahidic originals. The term Bohairic comes from Arabic <em>al-buhairah</em>, Lower (i.e. Northern) Egypt; it is generally assumed that Bohairic was the dialect of the Western Delta, including Alexandria and Nitria. The designation Memphitic has also been used for this dialect.</p>
			<p>Fayyumic, as its name implies, was the dialect of northern Middle Egypt in the vicinity of the Fayyum Basin. It is well attested in texts ranging from the fourth to the eleventh century, but it apparently never attained the status of Sahidic.</p>
			<p>Achmimic, generally located in the area of Akhmim (Panopolis) in southern Middle Egypt, enjoyed only a brief literary period from the third to the fifth century.</p>
			<p>Subachmimic, tentatively localized between Akhmim and Thebes, was used extensively in the fourth and fifth centuries for the translation of Manichaean and Gnostic literature. Its association with this heretical material probably had much to do with its early demise as a literary dialect. The Nag Hammadi texts are in Subachmimic or a variety of Sahidic influenced by Subachmimic in varying degrees.</p>
			<p>For further details on the dialects the reader should consult the works of Worrell, Vergote, Kahle, and Till cited in the Bibliography.</p>
			<p>The Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 A.D. and the subsequent suppression of the native Christian population resulted in the gradual dying out of the Egyptian language in favor of Arabic. We cannot be sure how long this process took, but it is safe to assume that by the fifteenth century Coptic had ceased to be a native spoken language, thus bringing to an end a continuous written record of over four thousand years.</p>
