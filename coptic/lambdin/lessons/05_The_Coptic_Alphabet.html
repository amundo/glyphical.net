          Sahidic Coptic is written in the Greek alphabet augmented by six
          letters borrowed from Demotic script, the last stage of Egyptian
          hieroglyphic writing. The letters of the full alphabet, together with
          their conventional transcription, are as follows:

          The following paragraphs deal with the Coptic, not the Greek,
          pronunciation of this alphabet.

        <h3 id="spelling-and-pronunciation">Spelling and Pronunciation<a href="#lesson-header" class="top-link">‚¨Ü</a></h3>
        <h4>a. The Consonants</h4>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤É</span> was apparently pronounced like English
          <em>v</em> in <em>voice</em>, but it is generally read simply as
          <em>b</em> in <em>back</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Ö</span> occurs only as a positional variant of
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ï</span> in a very small set of forms. Pronounced like
          the <em>g</em> of <em>good</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤á</span> and <span lang="cop">‚≤ç</span> do not normally
          occur in standard Sahidic spelling. <span lang="cop">‚≤ç</span> may occur
          for <span lang="cop">‚≤•</span> in a few words, e.g.
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤õ‚≤ç‚≤è‚≤É‚≤â</span> for
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤õ‚≤•‚≤è‚≤É‚≤â</span> school. Pronounced <em>d</em> as in
          <em>dog</em> and <em>z</em> as in <em>zoo</em> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤´</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤ë</span>, and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤≠</span> occur in Sahidic Coptic words only as
          combinations of two consonants: <span lang="cop">‚≤°</span> +
          <span lang="cop">œ©</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤ß</span> +
          <span lang="cop">œ©</span>, and <span lang="cop">‚≤ï</span> +
          <span lang="cop">œ©</span> respectively. <span lang="cop">‚≤ë</span> is
          fairly frequent, e.g. <span lang="cop">‚≤°‚≤â‚≤ë‚≤ü‚≤ü‚≤©</span> evil, for
          <span lang="cop">‚≤°‚≤â‚≤ß œ©‚≤ü‚≤ü‚≤©</span>. <span lang="cop">‚≤´</span> and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤≠</span> are rare and need not be used at all. The
          Copts seem to have used this same pronunciation for these letters in
          Greek words, contrary to the ordinary Greek pronunciation of
          <span lang="cop">‚≤´</span> as <em>f</em>, <span lang="cop">‚≤ë</span> as
          <em>th</em> (<em>thin</em>), and <span lang="cop">‚≤≠</span> as
          <em>ch</em> (German <em>ich</em>, <em>ach</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ï</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤°</span>, and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ß</span> were like English <em>k</em>, <em>p</em>,
          <em>t</em>, but without aspiration. Thus, they were more like the
          <em>k</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>t</em> of <em>skin</em>, <em>spin</em>,
          <em>stop</em> than the aspirated sounds of <em>kin</em>, <em>pin</em>,
          <em>top</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ó</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤ô</span>, and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤õ</span> were probably the same as English <em>l</em>,
          <em>m</em>, and <em>n</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ù</span> is simply a combination of
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ï</span> + <span lang="cop">‚≤•</span>, rarely used. E.g.
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ù‚≤ü‚≤©‚≤£</span> ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤£</span> is conventionally pronounced like English
          <em>r</em> in <em>road</em>. Its actual pronunciation is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤•</span> was like English <em>s</em> in <em>see</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Ø</span> is simply <span lang="cop">‚≤°</span> +
          <span lang="cop">‚≤•</span>, rarely used. E.g.
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Ø‚≤ì‚≤ß‚≤â</span> nine (<em>psite</em>).
        </p>
        <p><span lang="cop">œ£</span> was the <em>sh</em> of <em>shall</em>.</p>
        <p><span lang="cop">œ•</span> was the <em>f</em> of <em>foot</em>.</p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">œ©</span> was probably like English <em>h</em> in
          <em>hope</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">œ´</span> is conventionally pronounced like the
          <em>j</em> of <em>judge</em>. Its actual pronunciation was probably
          closer to that of the [t ∏] of <em>tune</em>.¬π
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">œ≠</span>, conventionally like the <em>ch</em> of
          <em>church</em>, was probably closer to the [k ∏] of <em>cue</em>,
          <em>cute</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">œØ</span> is merely a graphic symbol for
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ß</span> + <span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span>, but it was the
          normal way to spell this sequence of sounds. E.g.
          <em lang="cop">œØ‚≤ô‚≤â</em> village (<em>time</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          ¬π Brackets are used to indicate phonetic pronunciation in standard
          phonetic symbols. Do not confuse these with the conventional
          transcriptions.
        </p>
        <h4>b. The simple vowels</h4>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å</span> like the <em>a</em> of <em>father</em>. E.g.
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Åœ•</span> [af] meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â</span> like the <em>e</em> of <em>let</em>. E.g.
          <span lang="cop">œ©‚≤â‚≤õ</span> [h…õn] some.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤è</span> probably like the <em>a</em> of
          <em>hate</em>. E.g. <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤è‚≤ß</span> [met] ten.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span> like the <em>i</em> of <em>machine</em>. This
          vowel is always spelled <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> in initial
          positions: <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì‚≤õ‚≤â</span> [√≠ne] to bring,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì‚≤•</span> [is] behold. Internally and finally the
          spelling alternates between <span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span> and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span>, but <span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span> is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ü</span> like the <em>o</em> of <em>log</em>,
          <em>fog</em>, <em>dog</em>, <em>off</em>, <em>on</em>. E.g.
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ß‚≤ü‚≤°</span> [t…îp] edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤©</span> does not appear as a simple vowel in Coptic
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ü‚≤©</span> is the normal writing of the vowel [u], the
          <em>oo</em> of <em>food</em>. E.g. <span lang="cop">‚≤õ‚≤ü‚≤©‚≤É</span> noub
          [nub] gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤±</span> like the <em>o</em> of <em>hope</em>. E.g.
          <span lang="cop">œ©‚≤±‚≤°</span> [hop] to hide.
        </p>
        <h4>c. Semivowels and diphthongs</h4>
        <p class="indented">
          The consonants <em>y</em> and <em>w</em> of English <em>yet</em> and
          <em>wet</em> are often referred to as semivowels because they are the
          same sounds as the vowels [i] and [u] of <em>beet</em> and
          <em>boot</em> very briefly articulated. The Coptic vowels
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> (<span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span>) and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ü‚≤©</span> may function as consonants in the same way.
          E.g. <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì‚≤±‚≤ß</span> [yot] father,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ü‚≤©‚≤ü‚≤°</span> [w…îp] to become pure.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          The semivowels <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> (<span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span>)
          and <span lang="cop">‚≤ü‚≤©</span> combine with a preceding simple vowel to
          form various diphthongs. Many of the diphthongs have more than one
          spelling; the reader should follow the spelling used in the Lessons.
          The diphthongs should be pronounced carefully, with the value of the
          single vowel as given above plus a final <em>y</em> or <em>w</em> as
          the case may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤ì</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤â‚≤ì</span> as in
          <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤Å‚≤â‚≤ì‚≤õ</span> [sayn] physician,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤ì‚≤°‚≤±‚≤ß</span> [ayp√≥t] I ran.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤©</span> (rarely <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤ü‚≤©</span>) as in
          <span lang="cop">‚≤õ‚≤Å‚≤©</span> [naw] to see,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤Å‚≤©‚≤°‚≤±‚≤ß</span> [awp√≥t] they ran.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> (less commonly <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤â‚≤ì</span>)
          as in <span lang="cop">‚≤°‚≤â‚≤ì‚≤£‚≤±‚≤ô‚≤â</span> [p…õyr√≥m…õ] this man. Although a
          knowledge of the grammar is necessary for making the correct
          distinction between <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> = [i] and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> = […õy], the problem is not a serious one: in
          normal Sahidic spelling <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì</span> has the value
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â</span> + <span lang="cop">‚≤ì</span> (1) in the
          demonstrative adjectives <span lang="cop">‚≤°‚≤â‚≤ì- ‚≤ß‚≤â‚≤ì- ‚≤õ‚≤â‚≤ì-</span> (Lesson
          5), (2) in the first person verbal prefixes of the forms

          <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤â‚≤ì-</span> (Lesson 21 and following), and in a few
          isolated words like <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ì‚≤â</span> […õy…õ] (Lesson 29).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤©</span> (rarely <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤ü‚≤©</span>), as in
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â‚≤©œ£‚≤Åœ´‚≤â</span> […õw≈°√°t ∏…õ] while they were talking.

        <h3 id="double-vowels">Double Vowels<a href="#lesson-header" class="top-link">‚¨Ü</a></h3>
        <p class="indented">
          The double writing of any of the simple vowels is generally understood
          to be an indication of the presence of a glottal stop, i.e. the
          complete but very brief stoppage of airflow in the glottis,
          conventionally indicated by  æ in transcription. Thus
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤Å‚≤Å‚≤É</span> <em>m√° æƒÉb</em> thirty,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤â‚≤â‚≤°‚≤â</span> <em>s√© æƒïpe</em> remainder,
          <span lang="cop">œ£‚≤ü‚≤ü‚≤°</span> <em>≈°√≥ æ≈èp</em> to be. The stress is on the
          first vowel; the vowel after the glottal stop was probably of very
          brief duration.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          Vowel doubling occurs in diphthongs as well, e.g.

        <p class="indented">
          One of the most distinctive features of Sahidic spelling is the short
          stroke placed over certain consonants or groups of consonants. This
          supralinear stroke, as it is called, indicates a syllable, but there
          is some disagreement among Coptic scholars on how this syllabification
          actually sounded in the spoken language. When the stroke is used over
          a voiced consonant such as <span lang="cop">‚≤õ</span>, it probably meant
          that the consonant is functioning as the vowel, i.e. the most sonorous
          part, of the syllable in question, exactly like the final
          <em>n</em> of English <em>button</em> and <em>sudden</em>,
          phonetically [-tnÃ•] and [-dnÃ•]. Thus, <span lang="cop">œ£‚≤õÃÖ‚≤ß</span> (to
          seek me) was pronounced [≈°nÃ•t] and <span lang="cop">‚≤õÃÖ‚≤ß</span> (to bring
          me) as [nÃ•t]. The voiced consonants capable of having this syllabic
          pronunciation are <span lang="cop">‚≤É</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤ó</span>,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ô</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤õ</span>, and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤£</span>, known mnemonically as the
          <em>blemner</em> consonants. Note that they are all voiced
          continuants, i.e. consonants whose voiced duration may be prolonged at
          will (remember that <span lang="cop">‚≤É</span> is <em>v</em>, not
          <em>b</em>). E.g.

          The stroke over the remaining consonants may be pronounced as a brief
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â</span> or as <em>…ô</em> (the first vowel of English
          <em>above</em>) before the consonant over which the stroke is placed,
          e.g. <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤°ÃÖ‚≤•‚≤±‚≤°œ•ÃÖ</span> [s…ôps√≥p…ôf] to entreat him. This
          pronunciation may also be used with the <em>blemner</em> consonants
          for the sake of convenience.

        <p class="indented">
          In non-standard texts, of which there are many, the vowel
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â</span> is often written instead of using the stroke
          (and vice versa), but most frequently in proclitic elements and
          initial clusters, e.g. <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤â‚≤°‚≤•‚≤±‚≤°œ•ÃÖ</span> =
          <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤°ÃÖ‚≤•‚≤±‚≤°œ•ÃÖ</span>, <span lang="cop">œ©‚≤â‚≤ô ‚≤°‚≤è‚≤ì</span> =
          <span lang="cop">œ©‚≤ôÃÖ ‚≤°‚≤è‚≤ì</span>. In standard spelling
          <span lang="cop">‚≤â</span> is used regularly instead of the stroke only
          when the consonant preceding the consonant that would have had the
          stroke is a <em>blemner</em>; thus <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤ü‚≤ï‚≤ô‚≤â‚≤ï</span> and
          <span lang="cop">‚≤õ‚≤üœ≠‚≤õ‚≤âœ≠</span> are words of the same pattern as
          <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤ü‚≤°‚≤•‚≤°ÃÖ</span> and <span lang="cop">‚≤•‚≤ü‚≤ó‚≤•‚≤óÃÖ</span>. This
          convention may have been adopted to prevent incorrect syllabification:
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤ü‚≤ï‚≤ô‚≤ï</span> could be read as [m…îÃÅkmÃ•k] or [m…îÃÅkm…ôk]. The
          chief exceptions are indeed words where a different syllabification is
          required: <span lang="cop">œ£‚≤ü‚≤ô‚≤õÃÖ‚≤ß</span> [≈°…îÃÅmnÃ•t] three,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ß‚≤±‚≤ô‚≤õÃÖ‚≤ß</span> [t√≥mnÃ•t] to befall. The
          <span lang="cop">‚≤õÃÖ</span> of these words is an intrusive (secondary)
          glide from the labial <span lang="cop">‚≤ô</span> to the dental
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ß</span>; the earlier forms were
          <span lang="cop">œ£‚≤ü‚≤ô‚≤ßÃÖ</span> and <span lang="cop">‚≤ß‚≤±‚≤ô‚≤ßÃÖ</span>. The
          convention likewise does not apply when the final consonant is also a
          <em>blemner</em>: <span lang="cop">‚≤õ‚≤Åœ©‚≤ô‚≤õÃÖ</span> [n√°hmnÃ•] to rescue us.
          Much of the variation between <span lang="cop">‚≤â</span> and a stroke
          that occurs in the writing of certain verbal prefixes (e.g.

          <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤Å‚≤£œ•ÃÖ-</span>, <span lang="cop">‚≤ô‚≤Å‚≤£‚≤âœ•-</span>) probably

          Coptic is a highly compounding language, mostly by prefixation. All
          prefixal elements are proclitic, i.e. unstressed and bound, to the
          word which stands last in the sequence, regardless of its length, e.g.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span lang="cop">œ©‚≤õÃÖ ‚≤ß‚≤âœ•‚≤ô‚≤õÃÖ‚≤ß‚≤Å‚≤ß‚≤ß‚≤Å‚≤ï‚≤ü</span> =

        <p>
          Any element designated as prefixal in the course of the Lessons should
          be considered as proclitic. All simple prepositions are proclitic,
          like
          <span lang="cop">œ©‚≤õÃÖ</span> in the above example, but for the sake of
          clarity they are written as separate words in this text.

          The main stress, then, is on the word standing at the end of the

            Final <span lang="cop">-‚≤ü‚≤©</span> is stressed except (1) when it is
            the suffixed pronoun of the 3rd person plural (a knowledge of the
            grammar will make this clear), and (2) in the words
            <span lang="cop">‚≤°‚≤Åœ©‚≤ü‚≤©</span> (back),

          Assimilation, for our present purposes, may be defined briefly as the
          alteration of a sound due to its proximity to another sound, usually
          resulting in greater phonetic compatibility. The final
          <span lang="cop">‚≤õÃÖ</span> of prefixal elements (e.g. prepositions,

          <span lang="cop">‚≤ôÃÖ</span> before <span lang="cop">‚≤°</span> and

          <span lang="cop">‚≤ß‚≤â‚≤õ‚≤°‚≤ì‚≤•‚≤ß‚≤ì‚≤•</span> (our faith). In some texts the
          particle <span lang="cop">‚≤õÃÖ</span>, which has several grammatical
          functions, assimilates completely to <span lang="cop">‚≤É</span>,
          <span lang="cop">‚≤ó</span>, and <span lang="cop">‚≤£</span>, e.g.
          <span lang="cop">‚≤õÃÖ‚≤É‚≤£ÃÖ‚≤£‚≤â</span> ‚Üí <span lang="cop">‚≤ÉÃÖ‚≤É‚≤£ÃÖ‚≤£‚≤â</span> (the
