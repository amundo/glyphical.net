          Sahidic Coptic is written in the Greek alphabet augmented by six
          letters borrowed from Demotic script, the last stage of Egyptian
          hieroglyphic writing. The letters of the full alphabet, together with
          their conventional transcription, are as follows:

          The following paragraphs deal with the Coptic, not the Greek,
          pronunciation of this alphabet.

        <h3 id="spelling-and-pronunciation">Spelling and Pronunciation<a href="#lesson-header" class="top-link">⬆</a></h3>
        <h4>a. The Consonants</h4>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲃ</span> was apparently pronounced like English
          <em>v</em> in <em>voice</em>, but it is generally read simply as
          <em>b</em> in <em>back</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲅ</span> occurs only as a positional variant of
          <span class="c">ⲕ</span> in a very small set of forms. Pronounced like
          the <em>g</em> of <em>good</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲇ</span> and <span class="c">ⲍ</span> do not normally
          occur in standard Sahidic spelling. <span class="c">ⲍ</span> may occur
          for <span class="c">ⲥ</span> in a few words, e.g.
          <span class="c">ⲁⲛⲍⲏⲃⲉ</span> for
          <span class="c">ⲁⲛⲥⲏⲃⲉ</span> school. Pronounced <em>d</em> as in
          <em>dog</em> and <em>z</em> as in <em>zoo</em> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲫ</span>, <span class="c">ⲑ</span>, and
          <span class="c">ⲭ</span> occur in Sahidic Coptic words only as
          combinations of two consonants: <span class="c">ⲡ</span> +
          <span class="c">ϩ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧ</span> +
          <span class="c">ϩ</span>, and <span class="c">ⲕ</span> +
          <span class="c">ϩ</span> respectively. <span class="c">ⲑ</span> is
          fairly frequent, e.g. <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲑⲟⲟⲩ</span> evil, for
          <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲧ ϩⲟⲟⲩ</span>. <span class="c">ⲫ</span> and
          <span class="c">ⲭ</span> are rare and need not be used at all. The
          Copts seem to have used this same pronunciation for these letters in
          Greek words, contrary to the ordinary Greek pronunciation of
          <span class="c">ⲫ</span> as <em>f</em>, <span class="c">ⲑ</span> as
          <em>th</em> (<em>thin</em>), and <span class="c">ⲭ</span> as
          <em>ch</em> (German <em>ich</em>, <em>ach</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲕ</span>, <span class="c">ⲡ</span>, and
          <span class="c">ⲧ</span> were like English <em>k</em>, <em>p</em>,
          <em>t</em>, but without aspiration. Thus, they were more like the
          <em>k</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>t</em> of <em>skin</em>, <em>spin</em>,
          <em>stop</em> than the aspirated sounds of <em>kin</em>, <em>pin</em>,
          <em>top</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲗ</span>, <span class="c">ⲙ</span>, and
          <span class="c">ⲛ</span> were probably the same as English <em>l</em>,
          <em>m</em>, and <em>n</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲝ</span> is simply a combination of
          <span class="c">ⲕ</span> + <span class="c">ⲥ</span>, rarely used. E.g.
          <span class="c">ⲝⲟⲩⲣ</span> ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲣ</span> is conventionally pronounced like English
          <em>r</em> in <em>road</em>. Its actual pronunciation is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲥ</span> was like English <em>s</em> in <em>see</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲯ</span> is simply <span class="c">ⲡ</span> +
          <span class="c">ⲥ</span>, rarely used. E.g.
          <span class="c">ⲯⲓⲧⲉ</span> nine (<em>psite</em>).
        </p>
        <p><span class="c">ϣ</span> was the <em>sh</em> of <em>shall</em>.</p>
        <p><span class="c">ϥ</span> was the <em>f</em> of <em>foot</em>.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ϩ</span> was probably like English <em>h</em> in
          <em>hope</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ϫ</span> is conventionally pronounced like the
          <em>j</em> of <em>judge</em>. Its actual pronunciation was probably
          closer to that of the [tʸ] of <em>tune</em>.¹
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ϭ</span>, conventionally like the <em>ch</em> of
          <em>church</em>, was probably closer to the [kʸ] of <em>cue</em>,
          <em>cute</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ϯ</span> is merely a graphic symbol for
          <span class="c">ⲧ</span> + <span class="c">ⲓ</span>, but it was the
          normal way to spell this sequence of sounds. E.g.
          <em class="c">ϯⲙⲉ</em> village (<em>time</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          ¹ Brackets are used to indicate phonetic pronunciation in standard
          phonetic symbols. Do not confuse these with the conventional
          transcriptions.
        </p>
        <h4>b. The simple vowels</h4>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲁ</span> like the <em>a</em> of <em>father</em>. E.g.
          <span class="c">ⲁϥ</span> [af] meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲉ</span> like the <em>e</em> of <em>let</em>. E.g.
          <span class="c">ϩⲉⲛ</span> [hɛn] some.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲏ</span> probably like the <em>a</em> of
          <em>hate</em>. E.g. <span class="c">ⲙⲏⲧ</span> [met] ten.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲓ</span> like the <em>i</em> of <em>machine</em>. This
          vowel is always spelled <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> in initial
          positions: <span class="c">ⲉⲓⲛⲉ</span> [íne] to bring,
          <span class="c">ⲉⲓⲥ</span> [is] behold. Internally and finally the
          spelling alternates between <span class="c">ⲓ</span> and
          <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span>, but <span class="c">ⲓ</span> is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲟ</span> like the <em>o</em> of <em>log</em>,
          <em>fog</em>, <em>dog</em>, <em>off</em>, <em>on</em>. E.g.
          <span class="c">ⲧⲟⲡ</span> [tɔp] edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲩ</span> does not appear as a simple vowel in Coptic
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲟⲩ</span> is the normal writing of the vowel [u], the
          <em>oo</em> of <em>food</em>. E.g. <span class="c">ⲛⲟⲩⲃ</span> noub
          [nub] gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲱ</span> like the <em>o</em> of <em>hope</em>. E.g.
          <span class="c">ϩⲱⲡ</span> [hop] to hide.
        </p>
        <h4>c. Semivowels and diphthongs</h4>
        <p class="indented">
          The consonants <em>y</em> and <em>w</em> of English <em>yet</em> and
          <em>wet</em> are often referred to as semivowels because they are the
          same sounds as the vowels [i] and [u] of <em>beet</em> and
          <em>boot</em> very briefly articulated. The Coptic vowels
          <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> (<span class="c">ⲓ</span>) and
          <span class="c">ⲟⲩ</span> may function as consonants in the same way.
          E.g. <span class="c">ⲉⲓⲱⲧ</span> [yot] father,
          <span class="c">ⲟⲩⲟⲡ</span> [wɔp] to become pure.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          The semivowels <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> (<span class="c">ⲓ</span>)
          and <span class="c">ⲟⲩ</span> combine with a preceding simple vowel to
          form various diphthongs. Many of the diphthongs have more than one
          spelling; the reader should follow the spelling used in the Lessons.
          The diphthongs should be pronounced carefully, with the value of the
          single vowel as given above plus a final <em>y</em> or <em>w</em> as
          the case may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲁⲓ</span>, <span class="c">ⲁⲉⲓ</span> as in
          <span class="c">ⲥⲁⲉⲓⲛ</span> [sayn] physician,
          <span class="c">ⲁⲓⲡⲱⲧ</span> [aypót] I ran.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲁⲩ</span> (rarely <span class="c">ⲁⲟⲩ</span>) as in
          <span class="c">ⲛⲁⲩ</span> [naw] to see,
          <span class="c">ⲁⲩⲡⲱⲧ</span> [awpót] they ran.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> (less commonly <span class="c">ⲉⲉⲓ</span>)
          as in <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲓⲣⲱⲙⲉ</span> [pɛyrómɛ] this man. Although a
          knowledge of the grammar is necessary for making the correct
          distinction between <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> = [i] and
          <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> = [ɛy], the problem is not a serious one: in
          normal Sahidic spelling <span class="c">ⲉⲓ</span> has the value
          <span class="c">ⲉ</span> + <span class="c">ⲓ</span> (1) in the
          demonstrative adjectives <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲓ- ⲧⲉⲓ- ⲛⲉⲓ-</span> (Lesson
          5), (2) in the first person verbal prefixes of the forms
          <span class="c">ⲉⲓ-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲉⲓ-</span>,
          <span class="c">ⲙⲉⲓ-</span> (Lesson 21 and following), and in a few
          isolated words like <span class="c">ⲉⲓⲉ</span> [ɛyɛ] (Lesson 29).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲉⲩ</span> (rarely <span class="c">ⲉⲟⲩ</span>), as in
          <span class="c">ⲉⲩϣⲁϫⲉ</span> [ɛwšátʸɛ] while they were talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲏⲓ</span> as in <span class="c">ⲡⲏⲓ</span> [pey] the
          house.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲏⲩ</span> (less commonly <span class="c">ⲏⲟⲩ</span>)
          as in <span class="c">ⲧⲏⲩ</span> [tew] wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲓⲉⲓ</span>, <span class="c">ⲉⲓⲉⲓ</span> is very rare
          and is [yi] not [iy], e.g. <span class="c">ϩⲓⲉⲓⲃ</span> [hyib] lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲓⲟⲩ</span> is rare, e.g.
          <span class="c">ⲥⲓⲟⲩ</span> [siw] star.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲟⲉⲓ</span>, <span class="c">ⲟⲓ</span> as in
          <span class="c">ⲟⲩⲟⲉⲓⲛ</span> [wɔyn] light.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲟⲟⲩ</span> as in <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲟⲩ</span> [mɔw]
          water, <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲟⲩⲧ</span> [mɔwt] dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲱⲓ</span> as in <span class="c">ⲉϫⲱⲓ</span> [ɛtʸóy] on
          me; rare except in final position.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲱⲟⲩ</span> as in <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲟⲩⲛ</span> [town]
          to stand up, <span class="c">ⲉϫⲱⲟⲩ</span> [ɛtʸów] on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲟⲩⲓ</span> (rare) as in
          <span class="c">ⲛⲟⲩⲓ</span> [nuy] mine; also possibly as [wi] in some
          words, e.g. <span class="c">ⲕⲟⲩⲓ</span> [kwi] small.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ⲟⲩⲟⲩ</span> (rare) as in
          <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲩⲟⲩⲧ</span> [muwt] to kill,
          <span class="c">ⲛⲟⲩⲟⲩ</span> [nuw] theirs.
        </p>
        <h3 id="double-vowels">Double Vowels<a href="#lesson-header" class="top-link">⬆</a></h3>
        <p class="indented">
          The double writing of any of the simple vowels is generally understood
          to be an indication of the presence of a glottal stop, i.e. the
          complete but very brief stoppage of airflow in the glottis,
          conventionally indicated by ʾ in transcription. Thus
          <span class="c">ⲙⲁⲁⲃ</span> <em>máʾăb</em> thirty,
          <span class="c">ⲥⲉⲉⲡⲉ</span> <em>séʾĕpe</em> remainder,
          <span class="c">ϣⲟⲟⲡ</span> <em>šóʾŏp</em> to be. The stress is on the
          first vowel; the vowel after the glottal stop was probably of very
          brief duration.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          Vowel doubling occurs in diphthongs as well, e.g.
          <span class="c">ⲙⲁⲁⲩ</span> <em>máʾăw</em> mother,
          <span class="c">ⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉ</span> <em>méʾĕwe</em> to think. There is no
          sure way of knowing whether <span class="c">ⲟⲟⲩ</span> indicates [ɔw]
          or [ɔ́ʾɔ̆w].
        </p>
        <h3 id="syllabification-and-the-supralinear-stroke">Syllabification and the Supralinear Stroke<a href="#lesson-header" class="top-link">⬆</a></h3>
        <p class="indented">
          One of the most distinctive features of Sahidic spelling is the short
          stroke placed over certain consonants or groups of consonants. This
          supralinear stroke, as it is called, indicates a syllable, but there
          is some disagreement among Coptic scholars on how this syllabification
          actually sounded in the spoken language. When the stroke is used over
          a voiced consonant such as <span class="c">ⲛ</span>, it probably meant
          that the consonant is functioning as the vowel, i.e. the most sonorous
          part, of the syllable in question, exactly like the final
          <em>n</em> of English <em>button</em> and <em>sudden</em>,
          phonetically [-tn̥] and [-dn̥]. Thus, <span class="c">ϣⲛ̅ⲧ</span> (to
          seek me) was pronounced [šn̥t] and <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧ</span> (to bring
          me) as [n̥t]. The voiced consonants capable of having this syllabic
          pronunciation are <span class="c">ⲃ</span>, <span class="c">ⲗ</span>,
          <span class="c">ⲙ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛ</span>, and
          <span class="c">ⲣ</span>, known mnemonically as the
          <em>blemner</em> consonants. Note that they are all voiced
          continuants, i.e. consonants whose voiced duration may be prolonged at
          will (remember that <span class="c">ⲃ</span> is <em>v</em>, not

          The stroke over the remaining consonants may be pronounced as a brief
          <span class="c">ⲉ</span> or as <em>ə</em> (the first vowel of English
          <em>above</em>) before the consonant over which the stroke is placed,
          e.g. <span class="c">ⲥⲡ̅ⲥⲱⲡϥ̅</span> [səpsópəf] to entreat him. This
          pronunciation may also be used with the <em>blemner</em> consonants
          for the sake of convenience.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          In non-standard texts, of which there are many, the vowel
          <span class="c">ⲉ</span> is often written instead of using the stroke
          (and vice versa), but most frequently in proclitic elements and
          initial clusters, e.g. <span class="c">ⲥⲉⲡⲥⲱⲡϥ̅</span> =
          <span class="c">ⲥⲡ̅ⲥⲱⲡϥ̅</span>, <span class="c">ϩⲉⲙ ⲡⲏⲓ</span> =
          <span class="c">ϩⲙ̅ ⲡⲏⲓ</span>. In standard spelling
          <span class="c">ⲉ</span> is used regularly instead of the stroke only
          when the consonant preceding the consonant that would have had the
          stroke is a <em>blemner</em>; thus <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲕⲙⲉⲕ</span> and
          <span class="c">ⲛⲟϭⲛⲉϭ</span> are words of the same pattern as
          <span class="c">ⲥⲟⲡⲥⲡ̅</span> and <span class="c">ⲥⲟⲗⲥⲗ̅</span>. This
          convention may have been adopted to prevent incorrect syllabification:
          <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲕⲙⲕ</span> could be read as [mɔ́km̥k] or [mɔ́kmək]. The
          chief exceptions are indeed words where a different syllabification is
          required: <span class="c">ϣⲟⲙⲛ̅ⲧ</span> [šɔ́mn̥t] three,
          <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲙⲛ̅ⲧ</span> [tómn̥t] to befall. The
          <span class="c">ⲛ̅</span> of these words is an intrusive (secondary)
          glide from the labial <span class="c">ⲙ</span> to the dental
          <span class="c">ⲧ</span>; the earlier forms were
          <span class="c">ϣⲟⲙⲧ̅</span> and <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲙⲧ̅</span>. The
          convention likewise does not apply when the final consonant is also a
          <em>blemner</em>: <span class="c">ⲛⲁϩⲙⲛ̅</span> [náhmn̥] to rescue us.
          Much of the variation between <span class="c">ⲉ</span> and a stroke
          that occurs in the writing of certain verbal prefixes (e.g.
          <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣϥ̅-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉϥ-</span>;
          <span class="c">ⲙⲁⲣϥ̅-</span>, <span class="c">ⲙⲁⲣⲉϥ-</span>) probably
          results from inconsistent application of this rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forms <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲟⲩⲛ</span> (to arise) and
          <span class="c">ⲥⲟⲟⲩⲛ̅</span> (to know) have been standardized in the
          Lessons. In the Reading Selections the orthography of the source has
          been followed.

        <p>
          Coptic is a highly compounding language, mostly by prefixation. All
          prefixal elements are proclitic, i.e. unstressed and bound, to the
          word which stands last in the sequence, regardless of its length, e.g.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="c">ϩⲛ̅ ⲧⲉϥⲙⲛ̅ⲧⲁⲧⲧⲁⲕⲟ</span> =
          <span class="c">ϩⲛ̅-ⲧⲉ-ϥ-ⲙⲛ̅ⲧ-ⲁⲧ-ⲧⲁⲕⲟ́</span>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>in his imperishability</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Any element designated as prefixal in the course of the Lessons should
          be considered as proclitic. All simple prepositions are proclitic,
          like
          <span class="c">ϩⲛ̅</span> in the above example, but for the sake of
          clarity they are written as separate words in this text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main stress, then, is on the word standing at the end of the
          compound. The successive application of the following rules will
          enable the reader to apply the correct stress in all but the rarest
          cases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Stress is always on one of the last two syllables of a word.</li>
          <li>
            The vowels <span class="c">ⲏ</span>, <span class="c">ⲟ</span>, and
            <span class="c">ⲱ</span> are always stressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Final simple <span class="c">-ⲁ</span> and simple
            <span class="c">-ⲉⲓ</span>, <span class="c">-ⲓ</span> are always
            stressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Final <span class="c">-ⲟⲩ</span> is stressed except (1) when it is
            the suffixed pronoun of the 3rd person plural (a knowledge of the
            grammar will make this clear), and (2) in the words
            <span class="c">ⲡⲁϩⲟⲩ</span> (back),
            <span class="c">ⲥⲡⲟⲧⲟⲩ</span> (lips),
            <span class="c">ⲥⲁϩⲟⲩ</span> (curse), and
            <span class="c">ⲣⲁⲥⲟⲩ</span> (dream).
          </li>
          <li>
            Final <span class="c">-ⲉ</span> is unstressed except in the
            adjectives introduced in Lesson 15 (thus,
            <span class="c">ⲥⲁⲃⲉ́</span>, wise, <span class="c">ⲃⲗ̅ⲗⲉ́</span>,
            blind, etc.) and in a few miscellaneous words like
            <span class="c">ⲃⲉⲕⲉ́</span> (wages),
            <span class="c">ⲙⲛ̅ⲧⲣⲉ́</span> (witness),
            <span class="c">ⲕⲛ̅ⲧⲉ́</span> (figs),
            <span class="c">ⲛⲁⲙⲉ́</span> (truly).
          </li>
          <li>
            A final syllable marked by a stroked consonant is never stressed
            unless it is the only syllable of the word.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="assimilation">Assimilation<a href="#lesson-header" class="top-link">⬆</a></h3>
        <p class="indented">
          Assimilation, for our present purposes, may be defined briefly as the
          alteration of a sound due to its proximity to another sound, usually
          resulting in greater phonetic compatibility. The final
          <span class="c">ⲛ̅</span> of prefixal elements (e.g. prepositions,
          particles, articles) is regularly assimilated to
          <span class="c">ⲙ̅</span> before <span class="c">ⲡ</span> and
          <span class="c">ⲙ</span>, e.g.
        </p>
        <p>*<span class="c">ϩⲛ̅ ⲡⲏⲓ</span> → <span class="c">ϩⲙ̅ ⲡⲏⲓ</span></p>
        <p>in the house</p>
        <p>*<span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲙⲁⲉⲓⲛ</span> → <span class="c">ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲉⲓⲛ</span></p>
        <p>the signs</p>
        <p>
          The assimilation of consonant <span class="c">-ⲛ</span> also occurs
          but is not standard, e.g. <span class="c">ⲧⲉⲙⲡⲓⲥⲧⲓⲥ</span> for
          <span class="c">ⲧⲉⲛⲡⲓⲥⲧⲓⲥ</span> (our faith). In some texts the
          particle <span class="c">ⲛ̅</span>, which has several grammatical
          functions, assimilates completely to <span class="c">ⲃ</span>,
          <span class="c">ⲗ</span>, and <span class="c">ⲣ</span>, e.g.
          <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲃⲣ̅ⲣⲉ</span> → <span class="c">ⲃ̅ⲃⲣ̅ⲣⲉ</span> (the
          young), <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲣⲱⲙⲉ</span> →
          <span class="c">ⲣ̅ⲣⲱⲙⲉ</span> (the men). This is not considered
          standard, but it is not uncommon; numerous examples will be met in our
          reading selection from the Wisdom of Solomon.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          Whatever the pronunciation of the supralinear stroke was, an alternate
          spelling with <span class="c">-ⲁ-</span> often occurs before final
          <span class="c">-ϩ</span>: <span class="c">ⲱⲛⲁϩ</span> =
          <span class="c">ⲱⲛϩ̅</span> to live. This represents an assimilation to
          the guttural quality of <span class="c">ϩ</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          An alternation between <span class="c">-ⲱ-</span> and
          <span class="c">-ⲟⲩ-</span> in certain word patterns is a result of an
          assimilation in the pre-Coptic stage. <span class="c">ⲱ</span> was
          altered to <span class="c">ⲟⲩ</span> after
          <span class="c">ⲙ</span> and <span class="c">ⲛ</span>; thus, words
          like <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲩϩ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲟⲩϫⲉ</span>,
          <span class="c">ⲙⲟⲩⲟⲩⲧ</span>, and
          <span class="c">ⲛⲟⲩⲕ</span> originally had the same vowel as
          <span class="c">ⲕⲱⲧ</span>, <span class="c">ⲕⲱⲧⲉ</span>,
          <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲟⲩⲛ</span>, and

        <p class="indented">
          Greek words in Coptic are usually spelled correctly. Certain types of
          errors do occasionally occur, however, resulting in part from the
          discrepancy between the classical spelling and the contemporary
          pronunciation, and they must be taken into account when consulting a
          standard Greek dictionary. The most frequent of these are confusions
          between (1) <span class="c">ⲏ</span> and <span class="c">ⲩ</span>; (2)
          <span class="c">ⲉ</span> and <span class="c">ⲁⲓ</span>; (3)
