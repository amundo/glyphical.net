            The second sentence, known in English as a type of cleft sentence
            ("it was ... that/who ..."), singles out the subject ("my father and
            no one else") as the actor, while the first sentence merely
            describes a past action with no special emphasis. The Coptic
            correspondent of the English cleft sentence employs
            <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧⲉ</span>,
            <span class="c">ⲛⲉ</span> followed by the relative form of the verb.
            <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧⲉ</span>,
            <span class="c">ⲛⲉ</span> usually combine with the relative form to
            produce <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁⲓ-</span>,
