			<p class="indented">13.1 The Temporal. A special conjugation is used to express a subordinate temporal clause (English "when" with a simple past or pluperfect verb), as in</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲓⲛⲁⲩ ⲉⲣⲟϥ, ⲁⲓⲡⲱⲧ ϣⲁⲣⲟϥ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>When I saw him, I ran to him.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉϥϫⲱⲕ ⲙ̅ ⲡⲉϥϩⲱⲃ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ, ⲁϥⲃⲱⲕ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>When he had completed his work, he left.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>The full inflection of this form, called the Temporal Conjugation, is as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲓⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td><td>when I heard</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉⲕⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td><td>etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉϥⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉⲥⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲛ̅ⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉⲧⲛ̅ⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲟⲩⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉ-ⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>when the man heard</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>Alternate spellings, such as <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉⲓ-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲕ̅-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣϥ̅-</span>, are common.</p>
			<p class="indented">The Temporal is negated by prefixing <span class="c">-ⲧⲙ̅-</span> to the infinitive:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲓⲧⲙ̅ϭⲓⲛⲉ ⲙ̅ⲙⲟϥ</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>when I did not find him</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>With a nominal subject, <span class="c">-ⲧⲙ̅-</span> usually remains with the verbal prefix:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲉⲧⲙ̅-ⲡⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲟⲩⲱϣⲃ̅</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>when the man did not answer</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>A Temporal clause usually stands before the main clause, but occurrences after the main clause are not rare:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲓⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅ ⲉ ⲛⲉϥϣⲁϫⲉ, ⲁⲓⲣⲓⲙⲉ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁⲓⲣⲓⲙⲉ ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲓⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅ ⲉ ⲛⲉϥϣⲁϫⲉ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I wept when I heard his words.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>When a Temporal clause is continued with a second verb, the Temporal prefix is not repeated and the First Perfect is used:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲉⲣⲓⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅ ⲉ ⲡⲉϥϩⲣⲟⲟⲩ ⲁⲩⲱ ⲁⲓⲛⲁⲩ ⲉ ⲡⲉϥϩⲟ...</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>when I heard his voice and saw his face...</td>

			<p class="indented">13.2 Relative clauses with <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲉ</span>. Contrast the two sentences:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁ-ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲕⲁⲁⲧ ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲩ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>My father left me there.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲡⲉ ⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲕⲁⲁⲧ ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲩ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>It was my father who left me there.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>The second sentence, known in English as a type of cleft sentence ("it was ... that/who ..."), singles out the subject ("my father and no one else") as the actor, while the first sentence merely describes a past action with no special emphasis. The Coptic correspondent of the English cleft sentence employs <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲉ</span> followed by the relative form of the verb. <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲧⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲉ</span> usually combine with the relative form to produce <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁⲓ-</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲉⲛⲧⲁⲕ-</span>, etc.:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲕⲁⲁⲧ ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲩ.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>This form should not be confused with the nominalized relative <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁⲓⲥⲱⲧⲙ̅</span> etc., which consists of the definite article plus the relative form (see §12.3). Contrast</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲕⲁⲁⲧ ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲩ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>It was my father who left me there.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ ⲡⲉ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲕⲁⲁⲧ ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲩ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>My father is the one who left me there.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>The second sentence is a normal <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span> sentence: <span class="c">ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ</span> is the subject, <span class="c">ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲕⲁⲁⲧ ⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲩ</span> is the predicate.</p>
			<p class="indented">The cleft sentence with <span class="c">ⲡⲉ</span> is a favorite one with the interrogative pronouns:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲛⲓⲙ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁϥⲧⲛ̅ⲛⲟⲟⲩ ⲙ̅ⲙⲟⲕ?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Who sent you?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Who was it that sent you?</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲟⲩ ⲡⲉⲛⲧⲁⲕⲧⲁⲁϥ ⲛⲁⲩ?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>What did you give to them?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>What was it that you gave to them?</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>Note that in this case the English cleft sentence pattern ("who was it that") is slightly different from the one given above.</p>

			<p class="indented">13.3 The preposition <span class="c">ⲉ</span> is used before an infinitive to express purpose:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁⲓⲉⲓ ⲉ ϣⲁϫⲉ ⲛⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲕ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I have come to speak with you.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>The subject of the infinitive in this construction is usually the same as that of the main verb, but some laxness occurs, as in</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁϥⲧⲛ̅ⲛⲟⲟⲩ ⲙ̅ⲙⲟⲓ ⲉ ϣⲁϫⲉ ⲛⲙ̅ⲙⲁⲕ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>He sent me to speak with you.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
		</article><article id="section-4">
			<p class="indented">13.4 Coptic has no real passive conjugations. The passive is expressed by using the 3rd pers. pl. of the active form in an indefinite sense:</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁⲩⲧⲛ̅ⲛⲟⲟⲩ ⲙ̅ⲙⲟⲓ ϣⲁⲣⲟⲕ.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I have been sent to you.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>That such expressions are to be taken in a passive sense is most evident (1) when there is no clear reference for the pronoun "they", or (2) when an agent is added, usually with <span class="c">ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩⲓⲧⲛ̅</span>, as in</p>
			<table>
				<tbody><tr>
					<td class="c">ⲁⲩⲧⲛ̅ⲛⲟⲟⲩ ⲙ̅ⲙⲟⲓ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩⲓⲧⲙ̅ ⲡⲣ̅ⲣⲟ.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>I have been sent by the king.</td>

			<p class="indented">13.5 Infinitives (continued). Transitive infinitives of the pattern <span class="c">ⲕⲱⲧ</span> have the following forms:</p>
