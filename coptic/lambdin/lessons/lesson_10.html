          <p class="indented">The direct object of a transitive verb is
            usually introduced with the preposition

            It is unfortunate that the prenominal forms of the most frequent
            direct and indirect object markers are the same (<span class="c">ⲛ̅</span>, <span class="c">ⲙ̅</span> before <span class="c">ⲡ</span> and
            <span class="c">ⲙ</span>). In general the direct object precedes the
            indirect object unless the direct object is nominal and the indirect
            object is pronominal. In the latter case either order is correct,
            but there is a preference for placing the indirect object first. The
            preposition <span class="c">ⲉ</span> (<span class="c">ⲉⲣⲟ⸗</span>)
            also often marks what Greek and English regard as an indirect object
            (dative).

          <h3>10.4 Pronominal compounds of <span class="c">ⲧⲟⲟⲧ⸗</span></h3>
          <p class="indented">
            As noted in Lesson 9, many prepositions consist of a simple
            preposition compounded with a noun. The nouns occurring in these
            expressions belong to a special group which take pronominal suffixes
            to indicate possession. We shall deal with the more important of
            these individually in later lessons, but for the moment note
            <span class="c">ⲧⲟⲟⲧ⸗</span>, the pre-suffixal form of
            <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲣⲉ</span> (hand). The absolute form
            <span class="c">ⲧⲱⲣⲉ</span> survives only in the special meanings
            "handle, tool, spade" and in some compound verbal expressions (see
            Glossary); in the sense of "hand" it has been replaced by
            <span class="c">ϭⲓϫ</span>. Prepositions compounded with
            <span class="c">ⲧⲟⲟⲧ⸗</span>, such as
            <span class="c">ϩⲓⲧⲟⲟⲧ⸗</span>, <span class="c">ⲉⲧⲟⲟⲧ⸗</span>,
            <span class="c">ⲛ̅ⲧⲟⲟⲧ⸗</span>, often employ a construction with an
            anticipatory pronominal object before the real nominal object, the
            latter being introduced by the particle
            <span class="c">ⲛ̅</span> (<span class="c">ⲙ̅</span>):
