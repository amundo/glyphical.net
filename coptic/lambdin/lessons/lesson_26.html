          <h3>26.1 Compound verbs</h3>
          <p class="indented">
            Coptic vocabulary is particularly rich in
            compound verbs. Most compound verbs consist of a simple infinitive
            in the prenominal form plus a nominal element, usually without an
            article, e.g. <span class="c">ϯ-ⲉⲟⲟⲩ</span> to praise,
            <span class="c">ϫⲓ-ⲃⲁⲡⲧⲓⲥⲙⲁ</span> to be baptized. Meanings are for
            the most part predictable from those of the components.
          </p>
          <p class="indented">
            The verbs most frequently occurring in compounds are
            <span class="c">ϯ-</span> to give, <span class="c">ϫⲓ-</span> to
            take, <span class="c">ϥⲓ-</span> to raise, carry,
            <span class="c">ϭⲛ̅-</span> to find, <span class="c">ⲕⲁ-</span> to
            put, and <span class="c">ⲣ̅-</span> to do, make. Some examples:
          </p>
          <ul class="vocabulary">
            <li><span class="c">ϯ-ⲕⲁⲣⲡⲟⲥ</span> to produce fruit.</li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ϯ-ⲙⲉⲧⲁⲛⲟⲓⲁ</span> to repent; to humble or abase
              one's self.
            </li>
            <li><span class="c">ϯ-ⲉⲟⲟⲩ ⲛⲁ⸗</span> to praise.</li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ϯ-ⲥⲃⲱ ⲛⲁ⸗</span> to teach someone (something:
              <span class="c">ⲉ</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ϫⲓ-ⲥⲃⲱ</span> to receive instruction, be taught
              (something: <span class="c">ⲉ</span>).
            </li>
            <li><span class="c">ϭⲛ̅-ⲙ̅ⲧⲟⲛ</span> to find rest.</li>
            <li><span class="c">ϭⲛ̅-ϩⲱⲃ ⲙⲛ̅</span> to have dealings with.</li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ϭⲙ̅-ϭⲟⲙ</span> (<span class="c">ϭⲛ̅-ϭⲟⲙ</span>) to
              have power, prevail (over); to be able (to do:
              <span class="c">ⲉ</span> + Inf.).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ϥⲓ-ⲣⲟⲟⲩϣ</span> to take heed, be concerned (for,
              about: <span class="c">ⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲛⲁ⸗</span>,
              <span class="c">ⲉⲧⲃⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ϩⲁ</span>).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Compounds with <span class="c">ⲣ̅-</span> are the most frequent of
            all and fall into two groups. In the first group
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-</span> has its basic meaning "to do, make,
            perform":
          </p>
          <ul class="vocabulary">
            <li>
              <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲛⲟⲃⲉ</span> to sin (against:
              <span class="c">ⲉ</span>).
            </li>
            <li><span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲟⲩ</span> to do what?</li>
            <li><span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲁⲓ</span> to do this, thus.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-X ⲛ̅ ⲣⲟⲙⲡⲉ</span> (X is a number) has two meanings:
            (1) to reach the age of X; (2) to pass X years.
          </p>
          <p class="indented">
            In the second group of <span class="c">ⲣ̅-</span> compounds
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-</span> has the meaning "to become", e.g.
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲣ̅ⲣⲟ</span> to become king (over:
            <span class="c">ⲉϫⲛ̅</span>). The second element may be virtually any
            noun or adjective in the language, so that a complete catalogue is
            impossible. Qualitatives are uniformly <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅</span>,
            as in <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅ ⲣ̅ⲣⲟ</span> to be king. Further examples:
          </p>
          <ul class="vocabulary">
            <li>
              <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ϩⲗ̅ⲗⲟ</span> to grow old;
              <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅ ϩⲗ̅ⲗⲟ</span> to be old.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ϩⲏⲅⲉⲙⲱⲛ</span> to become governor;
              <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅ ϩⲏⲅⲉⲙⲱⲛ</span> to be governor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ</span> to become lord, master (over:
              <span class="c">ⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲉϫⲛ̅</span>);
              <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅ ϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ</span> to be lord, master.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The distinction between these two groups is often blurred, however,
            with qualitatives of the <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅</span> type being
            extended to the first group as well, e.g.
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ϣⲡⲏⲣⲉ</span> to marvel, become amazed (at:
            <span class="c">ⲙ̅ⲙⲟ⸗</span>, <span class="c">ⲉ</span>,
            <span class="c">ⲉⲧⲃⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲉϫⲛ̅</span>), to admire;
            Q <span class="c">ⲟ ⲛ̅ ϣⲡⲏⲣⲉ</span> to be amazed.
          </p>
          <p class="indented">
            Less frequently the nominal element of a compound verb has the
            definite article:
          </p>
          <ul class="vocabulary">
            <li>
              <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲱⲃϣ̅</span> to forget (<span class="c">ⲛ̅</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉ</span> to remember (<span class="c">ⲛ̅</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="c">ϯ-ⲑⲉ ⲛⲁ⸗</span> to provide the means to someone
              (so that: <span class="c">ⲉ</span>, <span class="c">ⲉⲧⲣⲉ</span>).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the case of <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲱⲃϣ̅</span>,
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉ</span>, and many others of this type a
            pronominal object is expressed by a possessive prefix on the noun:
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲉϥⲱⲃϣ̅</span> to forget him,
            <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲉϥⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉ</span> to remember him.
          </p>
          <p class="indented">
            Because compound verbs employ the prenominal form of the infinitive,
            the question arises concerning their occurrence in the Bipartite
            Conjugation, where the prenominal form is usually prohibited. In
            general, compound verbs are an exception to Jernstedt's Rule and may
            be used freely as they stand in the Bipartite Conjugation. Two types
            of compounds, however, do tend to follow Jernstedt's Rule:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                the type <span class="c">ⲣ̅-ⲡⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉ</span>, with the definite
                article on the noun. In the Bipartite Conjugation the full form
                of the infinitive is used. Contrast

            26.3 Infinitives of the type <span class="c">ⲧⲁⲕⲟ</span>. There is a
            fairly large group of verbs whose infinitives begin with
            <span class="c">ⲧ-</span> and end in <span class="c">-ⲟ</span>, e.g.
            <span class="c">ⲧⲁⲕⲟ ⲧⲁⲕⲉ- ⲧⲁⲕⲟ⸗</span> Q
            <span class="c">ⲧⲁⲕⲏⲩ</span> to destroy. At an older stage of
            Egyptian these verbs were compound causatives with a form of
            <span class="c">ϯ</span> (to give) plus a verbal form inflected by
            suffixation. Thus, the original construction involved two verbs
            (e.g. I <em>caused</em> that he <em>pay</em> a fine) which coalesced
            into a single verb with two objects (I caused <em>him</em> to pay a
            <em>fine</em>). Traces of the older construction survive in Sahidic,
            e.g. Luke 3:14 <span class="c">ⲙ̅ⲡⲣ̅ⲧⲧⲉ-ⲗⲁⲁⲩ ⲟⲥⲉ</span> Do not make
            anyone pay a fine (i.e. suffer a loss).
            <span class="c">ⲧⲧⲟ ⲧⲧⲉ-</span> is the causative of
            <span class="c">ϯ</span> itself. The lack of an object marker on the
            second object is characteristic of the construction, but the absence
            of an article in this particular example stems from its association
            with the compound verb <span class="c">ϯ-ⲟⲥⲉ</span> to pay a fine,
            suffer a loss. In general, however, there is no need to take the
            older construction into account in Coptic, since most of these verbs
            are simply transitive. Some examples:
