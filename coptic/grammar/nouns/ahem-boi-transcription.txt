## Nouns in ⲟ

In masculine nouns that end with ⲟ

Their plurals turn the ⲟ into an ⲱ and adds ⲟⲩ

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲟⲩⲣⲟ | Ⲟⲩⲣⲱⲟⲩ |
| Ⲓⲁⲣⲟ | Ⲓⲁⲣⲱⲟⲩ |

Exceptions being ϧⲉⲗⲗⲟ and ⲣⲁⲙⲁⲟ, being ϧⲉⲗⲗⲟⲓ and ⲣⲁⲙⲁⲟⲓ
But ⲣⲁⲙⲁⲱⲟⲩ also works

## Nouns in ⲉ

Likewise with nouns that end with ⲉ

You turn ⲉ into a ⲏ and add ⲟⲩ

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲃⲉⲭⲉ | Ⲃⲉⲭⲏⲟⲩ |
| Ϣ̀ϫⲉ | Ϣ̀ϫⲏⲟⲩ |

## Nouns in ⲉ

Derived names that end with ⲉ like ⲥⲁⲃⲉ coming from ⲥⲃⲱ and ⲑⲉϣⲉ coming from ⲑⲱϣ get pluraled by adding a ⲩ in the ending

So it is:

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲥⲁⲃⲉ | Ⲥⲁⲃⲉⲩ |
| Ϣⲁϥⲉ | Ϣⲁϥⲉⲩ |
| Ⲑⲉϣⲉ | Ⲑⲉϣⲉⲩ |

## Irregular plural nouns

Irregular plural nouns that end with consonants get pluraled in 4 ways

### 1: Adding ⲩ to the vowel before the last consonant and turn the vowel into ⲁ if it isn't already

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| ⲥ̀ⲛⲁϩ | ⲥ̀ⲛⲁⲩϩ |
| ⲙ̀ⲕⲁϩ | ⲙ̀ⲕⲁⲩϩ |
| ϭⲁⲗⲟϫ | ϭⲁⲗⲁⲩϫ |

### 2: Nouns in ⲟⲣ

If the last consonant is ⲣ and the vowel that comes before it is ⲟ, it gets strengthened into a ⲱ, and this rule applies to some other nouns than I think had the ⲣ in older Egyptian but they fell:

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲟⲩϩⲟⲣ | ⲟⲩϩⲱⲣ |
| Ϩ̀ⲑⲟ | Ϩ̀ⲑⲱⲣ |

### 3: Nouns in ⲏⲧ or ⲓⲧ

Words ending in ⲏⲧ or ⲓⲧ get pluraled into ⲁϯ as their end

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲃⲏⲧ | Ⲃⲁϯ |
| Ⲙⲉⲛⲣⲓⲧ | Ⲙⲉⲛⲣⲁϯ |
| Ϩⲁⲗⲏⲧ | Ϩⲁⲗⲁϯ |

### 4: Nouns with strong vowels aka ⲏ or ⲱ/ⲟⲩ

Nouns with strong vowels aka ⲏ or ⲱ/ⲟⲩ get turned into weaker vowels ⲉ and ⲟ and get a ⲓ in their ends


| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ | Ⲁⲫⲟⲫⲓ |
| Ⲁⲃⲱⲕ | Ⲁⲃⲟⲕⲓ |
| Ϣ̀ⲫⲏⲣ | Ϣ̀ⲫⲉⲣⲓ |
| Ⲓⲱⲧ | Ⲓⲟϯ |

The oddities that don't follow any of the last ones being

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲥⲟⲛ | Ⲥ̀ⲛⲏⲟⲩ |
| Ϫⲟⲓ | Ⲉ̀ϫⲏⲟⲩ |

## For feminine(able) nouns:

### 1: Nouns in ⲱ or ⲏ

Nouns that end with ⲱ or ⲏ get ⲟⲩⲓ added to them

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲉⲧⲫⲱ | Ⲉⲧⲫⲱⲟⲩⲓ |
| Ⲉⲣⲙⲏ | Ⲉⲣⲙⲱⲟⲩⲓ (Here ⲏ was turned into ⲱ) |

And that applies to some masculine(able) nouns such as:

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲁⲗⲟⲩ | Ⲁⲗⲱⲟⲩⲓ |
| Ⲣⲉϥϫⲱ | Ⲣⲉϥϫⲱⲟⲩⲓ |
| Ⲥⲫⲓⲣ | Ⲥⲫⲓⲣⲱⲟⲩⲓ |

But structure of the word changes

###  2: Feminine nouns in ⲉ

Feminine nouns that end with ⲉ turn the ⲉ into ⲏ and add ⲟⲩⲓ

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲁⲫⲉ | Ⲁⲫⲏⲟⲩⲓ |
| Ⲫⲉ | Ⲫⲏⲟⲩⲓ |
| Ϧⲣⲉ | Ϧⲣⲏⲟⲩⲓ |

And this also applies to some masculines, by changing structure:

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ϩⲱⲃ | Ϩⲃⲏⲟⲩⲓ |
| Ⲉⲣⲫⲉⲓ | Ⲉⲣⲫⲱⲟⲩⲓ |

And last ones being irregulars to all we just said

| singular | plural |
|----------|--------|
| Ⲥ̀ϩⲓⲙⲓ | Ϩⲓⲟⲙⲓ |
| Ⲓⲟⲙ | Ⲁⲙⲁⲓⲟⲩ |
