## Translated

### In masculine nouns that end with ⲟ

Their plurals turn the ⲟ into an ⲱ and adds ⲟⲩ

Ⲟⲩⲣⲟ=>Ⲟⲩⲣⲱⲟⲩ
Ⲓⲁⲣⲟ=Ⲓⲁⲣⲱⲟⲩ

Exceptions being ϧⲉⲗⲗⲟ and ⲣⲁⲙⲁⲟ, being ϧⲉⲗⲗⲟⲓ and ⲣⲁⲙⲁⲟⲓ
But ⲣⲁⲙⲁⲱⲟⲩ also works

### Likewise with nouns that end with ⲉ

You turn ⲉ into a ⲏ and add ⲟⲩ

Ⲃⲉⲭⲉ=>Ⲃⲉⲭⲏⲟⲩ
Ϣ̀ϫⲉ=>Ϣ̀ϫⲏⲟⲩ

### Derived names that end with ⲉ like ⲥⲁⲃⲉ coming from ⲥⲃⲱ and ⲑⲉϣⲉ coming from ⲑⲱϣ Get pluraled by adding a ⲩ in the ending

So it is:

Ⲥⲁⲃⲉ=>Ⲥⲁⲃⲉⲩ
Ϣⲁϥⲉ=>Ϣⲁϥⲉⲩ
Ⲑⲉϣⲉ=>Ⲑⲉϣⲉⲩ

### Irregular plural nouns that end with consonants get pluraled in 4 ways

#### 1: Adding ⲩ to the vowel before the last consonant and turn the vowel into ⲁ if it isn't already 

ⲥ̀ⲛⲁϩ=>ⲥ̀ⲛⲁⲩϩ
ⲙ̀ⲕⲁϩ=>ⲙ̀ⲕⲁⲩϩ
ϭⲁⲗⲟϫ=>ϭⲁⲗⲁⲩϫ 

#### 2: if the last consonant is ⲣ and the vowel that comes before it is ⲟ, ir gets strengthened into a ⲱ, and this rule applies to some other nouns thar i think had the ⲣ in older Egyptian but they fell

Ⲟⲩϩⲟⲣ=>ⲟⲩϩⲱⲣ
Ϩ̀ⲑⲟ=>Ϩ̀ⲑⲱⲣ

#### 3: Words ending in ⲏⲧ or ⲓⲧ get pluraled into ⲁϯ as their end

Ⲃⲏⲧ=>Ⲃⲁϯ
Ⲙⲉⲛⲣⲓⲧ=>Ⲙⲉⲛⲣⲁϯ
Ϩⲁⲗⲏⲧ=>Ϩⲁⲗⲁϯ

#### 4: Nouns with strong vowels aka ⲏ or ⲱ/ⲟⲩ get turned into weaker vowels ⲉ and ⲟ and get a ⲓ in their ends

Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ=>Ⲁⲫⲟⲫⲓ
Ⲁⲃⲱⲕ=>Ⲁⲃⲟⲕⲓ
Ϣ̀ⲫⲏⲣ=>Ϣ̀ⲫⲉⲣⲓ
Ⲓⲱⲧ=>Ⲓⲟϯ 

The oddities that don't follow any of the last ones being 

Ⲥⲟⲛ=>Ⲥ̀ⲛⲏⲟⲩ
Ϫⲟⲓ=>Ⲉ̀ϫⲏⲟⲩ

### For feminine(able) nouns:

#### 1: Nouns that end with ⲱ or ⲏ get ⲟⲩⲓ added to them

Ⲉⲧⲫⲱ=>Ⲉⲧⲫⲱⲟⲩⲓ
Ⲉⲣⲙⲏ=>Ⲉⲣⲙⲱⲟⲩⲓ (Here ⲏ was turned into ⲱ)

And that applies to some masculine(able) nouns such as:

Ⲁⲗⲟⲩ=>Ⲁⲗⲱⲟⲩⲓ
Ⲣⲉϥϫⲱ=>Ⲣⲉϥϫⲱⲟⲩⲓ
Ⲥⲫⲓⲣ=>Ⲥⲫⲓⲣⲱⲟⲩⲓ


But structure of the word changes

####  2: Feminine nouns that end with ⲉ turn the ⲉ into ⲏ and add ⲟⲩⲓ

Ⲁⲫⲉ=>Ⲁⲫⲏⲟⲩⲓ
Ⲫⲉ=>Ⲫⲏⲟⲩⲓ
Ϧⲣⲉ=>Ϧⲣⲏⲟⲩⲓ

And this also applies to some masculines, by changing structure

Ϩⲱⲃ=>Ϩⲃⲏⲟⲩⲓ
Ⲉⲣⲫⲉⲓ=>Ⲉⲣⲫⲱⲟⲩⲓ

And last ones being irregulars to all we just said

Ⲥ̀ϩⲓⲙⲓ=>Ϩⲓⲟⲙⲓ
Ⲓⲟⲙ=>Ⲁⲙⲁⲓⲟⲩ
