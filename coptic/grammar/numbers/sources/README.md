Notes:								
(1) I consider Hebrew (or a closely related system) the original because tsade (צ) is in the right place &								
     Greek shows additional innovations (numbers above 400) and "residual" numbers-only signs								
(2) Tsade dropped out in Greek, causing qof (Q) to take the 90 slot, shifting all higher numbers up								
      Tsade was then added as "sampi" at the end as a numeral-only sign (900)								
(3) The cursive version of Qof in Greek looks a lot like Coptic fai ϥ, so I used that character								
     None of the demotic characters have a numeral value in Coptic								
(4) Arabic shows two systems. As in the Greek system, it's the s-sounds that create havoc and the								
     additional letters are tagged on at the end.								
(5) The word-final forms of Hebrew letters can be used to write the numbers 500 and higher, but that								
     usage is said to be of a later date, with an additive method being used earlier (shown here)
