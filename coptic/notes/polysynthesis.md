title: Is Coptic polysynthetic?
author: Patrick Hall

In this note I will consider the question of whether Coptic should be considered a polysynthetic langauge. 



## Loprieno

Loprieno thinks that Coptic _is_ polysynthetic:

He describes a verbal template with the following “columns”:

1. conjugation base (from a conjugated form of _to do_)
2. nominal or proniminal subject
3. infinitive

> (d) Already in Late Egyptian, and increasingly in the more recent phases
of later Egyptian, verbal patterns tend to be organized within a tripartite 
sequence of conjugation base (often derived from a conjugated form of
"to do"), nominal or pronominal subject, and infinitive, and to acquire
autonomy as main sentences or dependent clauses: for example, the earlier
Egyptian construction with the negative particle _nj_ followed by the past form
_n j sDm.n=f_ “he cannot hear” becomes in later Egyptian the form bw-jr=f-sdm,
in which _bw_ is still recognizable as the negative morpheme but is not used
productively in the language, being found only in a few bound verbal
constructions, and in Coptic me-y-cm~K,which is not even any longer
segmentable into discrete units, but rather represents a functional equivalent
to the morphologically quite distinct positive form gla+-cm~X "he hears."

> This evolution had a profound impact at the typological level, causing
Egyptian on the one hand to grammaticalize dependent clauses as paradig-
matic units (for example the temporal m-& jr=f-sdm > R ~ ~ p e q c m ~ X"when
he heard" or the conditional Demotic j.jr=f-bn-sdm > eyglancm~X"if he
hears"), on the other hand to move from the fusional nature of its earlier
phases (section 4.1) to the p 4 v n t h e t i c type: 186 in Coptic, sentence and clause
conjugation, often followed by the verbal object, are combined into a single
prosodic unit, i.e. into one word: Ps 68,22 a t r r c e r o v p ~(a=u-tse-~i-ou-hm~J
l?awtsaj'whemc/ "they let me drink vinegar" < Late Egyptian *jr=w dj.t s w e j
w'-bmd, lit. "they did (ifiw) causing (dj.t) that I drink (swr=jJ vinegar" < earlier
Egyptian ow) dj-n-sn s w j etc.; Lk 23,35 mapeymaaoy (mare=f-toujef)
ImaraftaWjofl "let him save himself" < *jm jr=f-dj.t-w&/, lit. "let him do (irn
jfif) causiq (dj.t) that he be safe (wd3-f)" < earlier Egyptian #& f w&=f "may
he cause (a-f)that he be safe." This change from the fusional to the poly-
synthetic type represents a major typological evolution in the history of
Egyptian and is unparalleled in other families of the Afroasiatic phylum
