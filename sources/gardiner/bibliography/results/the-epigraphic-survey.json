    "description": "The epigraphic record of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is completed. With the publication of this seventh volume the greatest and most painstaking epigraphic project ever undertaken in Egypt comes to an end. While excavations are likely to receive widespread attention, appreciation of the equally important, though less spectacular, epigraphic work is comparatively small. Its significance was properly conceived by the late James Henry Breasted, for whom the accurate recording of extant inscriptions was one of the main aims of the Oriental Institute at its founding. Copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions had been made since the days of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, but despite their merits those were not facsimiles, i.e., records which represent an inscription in exacting detail. When the Oriental Institute began its ambitious program no one could envisage the difficulties the epigraphic recording of a major monument would bring. Although it took long to complete the task, the accomplishments justify the efforts put into the project. Not only has the Oriental Institute provided a model publication of one of the most important monuments preserved from ancient Egypt, it also has set the standards for epigraphic recording. Volume VII records the scanty remains of the westernmost part of the Temple with the \"Holy of Holies\" and its surrounding rooms. In addition, it also contains drawings of two series of scenes depicting various deities of Egypt in a kind of \"pantheon.\" The one is on the inner faces of the outer walls of the Temple Proper, the other on the exterior of the outer walls. The editors used this final volume to include key-plans for the recording of the Temple in the seven volumes, which should prove most useful. Equally welcome is a concordance of the \"Belegstellen\" to the Erman-Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache with the publication of Medinet Habu. The completion of the recording of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is a festive occasion not only for those directly connected with the project, but for the entire field of Egyptology. Gratitude and congratulations are to be extended to those who have spent time and energy to complete this record, and also to those who have made it possible. The Oriental Institute with its Epigraphic Survey has greatly helped the study of ancient Egypt and hopefully will continue it by recording the other monuments at Medinet Habu in like fashion. [From a review by Hans Goedicke in the American Journal of Archaeology 69 (1965) 271-72].",

Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III, The Epigraphic Survey, Oriental Institute Publications 8, 1930). The Ramesside temple and the High Gate were to occupy the efforts of the Survey for the next four decades, ending in 1970 with the appearance of Medinet Habu VIII. In resuming the Medinet Habu series, the Survey initiates what is envisioned to be a sequence of five volumes documenting the Eighteenth Dynasty temple of Amun and subsequent additions thereto, beginning with this publication of the reliefs in the six innermost rooms of the temple. These chambers were begun during the coregency of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and completed by the latter king during his sole reign.",

    "description": "At the end of the last century, during the first year of his commission to copy inscriptions for the proposed German-Egyptian dictionary, Professor James Henry Breasted wrote, \"I am now laying plans to copy not merely the historical, but allthe inscriptions of Egypt and publish them. This will require $25,000 a year for fifteen or twenty years.\" It was not until 1924 that he was able to put his plan into action. The initial site selected was the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. The first months of work by the Epigraphic Survey showed that a complete and accurate record required more time and care than Professor Breasted had envisaged. The methods of copying which he described in the first volume of Medinet Habu have been followed in all subsequent work of the expedition, and the Epigraphic Survey has produced what it believes are as accurate facsimile reproductions of the ancient reliefs as are possible. The present volume completes the documentation of the reliefs and inscriptions on the buildings at Medinet Habu constructed and decorated during the reign of Ramses III. Its Eastern High Gate is a structure unique among the extant ancient buildings of Egypt. The architecture has been studied by Professor Uvo Hölscher, and the relevant parts of his publications should be consulted. [From the Preface, p. xi, by Charles F. Nims].",

It was intended to be the final resting place for Kheruef, royal scribe and steward to Amenhotep III’s principal wife, Queen Tiye, but the tomb was abandoned before completion and Kheruef was apparently buried elsewhere. The significance of the tomb comes from the superb artistic quality of its reliefs and the historical information provided by some of the scenes and accompanying inscriptions for the transition from Amenhotep III’s reign to that of his son and successor, Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. The present volume, the outcome of a cooperative project started in 1957 by the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities of Egypt, is the definitive publication of the tomb.",

Not only is The Festival Procession of Opet the Survey's largest volume to date, it is also the most sophisticated in terms of the finesse of the rendering of the facsimile drawings with indications of the different types of man-made and environmental damage suffered by the complicated surviving Luxor Temple Colonnade Hall reliefs indicated in minute details - which must have taken countless hours of inking by the many Survey artists (eighteen by actual count) who worked six months in the field each year recording the Opet Festival reliefs from 1974 to 1992. These marvelous large drawings (each a work of art in its own right), along with the accompanying text volume (with list of plates, preface, transliterations and translations of the texts, commentary, and glossary) make the (cost) of this achievement fully justified. Any serious student of the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty who orders [this volume] sight unseen will not be disappointed when it arrives. [From a book brief in KMT 5:4 (1994/95) 86].",

Included in this volume are reconstructions of the Eighteenth Dynasty facade of the hall, the northern and southern doorjamb reliefs, the upper register scenes, the decoration of the columns and their architraves, the dedicatory bandeau texts of the New Kingdom, graffiti from the later periods, and the three colossal statues that still stand in the northern end of the hall. The plates are accompanied by a booklet of translations and commentary on the iconographic and textual additions and revisions that were made by a long succession of Egyptian rulers and reflect the complex history of the monument.",

    "description": "The epigraphic record of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is completed. With the publication of this seventh volume the greatest and most painstaking epigraphic project ever undertaken in Egypt comes to an end. While excavations are likely to receive widespread attention, appreciation of the equally important, though less spectacular, epigraphic work is comparatively small. Its significance was properly conceived by the late James Henry Breasted, for whom the accurate recording of extant inscriptions was one of the main aims of the Oriental Institute at its founding. Copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions had been made since the days of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, but despite their merits those were not facsimiles, i.e., records which represent an inscription in exacting detail. When the Oriental Institute began its ambitious program no one could envisage the difficulties the epigraphic recording of a major monument would bring. Although it took long to complete the task, the accomplishments justify the efforts put into the project. Not only has the Oriental Institute provided a model publication of one of the most important monuments preserved from ancient Egypt, it also has set the standards for epigraphic recording. Volume VII records the scanty remains of the westernmost part of the Temple with the \"Holy of Holies\" and its surrounding rooms. In addition, it also contains drawings of two series of scenes depicting various deities of Egypt in a kind of \"pantheon.\" The one is on the inner faces of the outer walls of the Temple Proper, the other on the exterior of the outer walls. The editors used this final volume to include key-plans for the recording of the Temple in the seven volumes, which should prove most useful. Equally welcome is a concordance of the \"Belegstellen\" to the Erman-Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache with the publication of Medinet Habu. The completion of the recording of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is a festive occasion not only for those directly connected with the project, but for the entire field of Egyptology. Gratitude and congratulations are to be extended to those who have spent time and energy to complete this record, and also to those who have made it possible. The Oriental Institute with its Epigraphic Survey has greatly helped the study of ancient Egypt and hopefully will continue it by recording the other monuments at Medinet Habu in like fashion. [From a review by Hans Goedicke in the American Journal of Archaeology 69 (1965) 271-72].",

Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III, The Epigraphic Survey, Oriental Institute Publications 8, 1930). The Ramesside temple and the High Gate were to occupy the efforts of the Survey for the next four decades, ending in 1970 with the appearance of Medinet Habu VIII. In resuming the Medinet Habu series, the Survey initiates what is envisioned to be a sequence of five volumes documenting the Eighteenth Dynasty temple of Amun and subsequent additions thereto, beginning with this publication of the reliefs in the six innermost rooms of the temple. These chambers were begun during the coregency of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and completed by the latter king during his sole reign.",

    "description": "At the end of the last century, during the first year of his commission to copy inscriptions for the proposed German-Egyptian dictionary, Professor James Henry Breasted wrote, \"I am now laying plans to copy not merely the historical, but allthe inscriptions of Egypt and publish them. This will require $25,000 a year for fifteen or twenty years.\" It was not until 1924 that he was able to put his plan into action. The initial site selected was the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. The first months of work by the Epigraphic Survey showed that a complete and accurate record required more time and care than Professor Breasted had envisaged. The methods of copying which he described in the first volume of Medinet Habu have been followed in all subsequent work of the expedition, and the Epigraphic Survey has produced what it believes are as accurate facsimile reproductions of the ancient reliefs as are possible. The present volume completes the documentation of the reliefs and inscriptions on the buildings at Medinet Habu constructed and decorated during the reign of Ramses III. Its Eastern High Gate is a structure unique among the extant ancient buildings of Egypt. The architecture has been studied by Professor Uvo Hölscher, and the relevant parts of his publications should be consulted. [From the Preface, p. xi, by Charles F. Nims].",

It was intended to be the final resting place for Kheruef, royal scribe and steward to Amenhotep III’s principal wife, Queen Tiye, but the tomb was abandoned before completion and Kheruef was apparently buried elsewhere. The significance of the tomb comes from the superb artistic quality of its reliefs and the historical information provided by some of the scenes and accompanying inscriptions for the transition from Amenhotep III’s reign to that of his son and successor, Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. The present volume, the outcome of a cooperative project started in 1957 by the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities of Egypt, is the definitive publication of the tomb.",

Not only is The Festival Procession of Opet the Survey's largest volume to date, it is also the most sophisticated in terms of the finesse of the rendering of the facsimile drawings with indications of the different types of man-made and environmental damage suffered by the complicated surviving Luxor Temple Colonnade Hall reliefs indicated in minute details - which must have taken countless hours of inking by the many Survey artists (eighteen by actual count) who worked six months in the field each year recording the Opet Festival reliefs from 1974 to 1992. These marvelous large drawings (each a work of art in its own right), along with the accompanying text volume (with list of plates, preface, transliterations and translations of the texts, commentary, and glossary) make the (cost) of this achievement fully justified. Any serious student of the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty who orders [this volume] sight unseen will not be disappointed when it arrives. [From a book brief in KMT 5:4 (1994/95) 86].",

    "description": "The epigraphic record of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is completed. With the publication of this seventh volume the greatest and most painstaking epigraphic project ever undertaken in Egypt comes to an end. While excavations are likely to receive widespread attention, appreciation of the equally important, though less spectacular, epigraphic work is comparatively small. Its significance was properly conceived by the late James Henry Breasted, for whom the accurate recording of extant inscriptions was one of the main aims of the Oriental Institute at its founding. Copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions had been made since the days of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, but despite their merits those were not facsimiles, i.e., records which represent an inscription in exacting detail. When the Oriental Institute began its ambitious program no one could envisage the difficulties the epigraphic recording of a major monument would bring. Although it took long to complete the task, the accomplishments justify the efforts put into the project. Not only has the Oriental Institute provided a model publication of one of the most important monuments preserved from ancient Egypt, it also has set the standards for epigraphic recording. Volume VII records the scanty remains of the westernmost part of the Temple with the \"Holy of Holies\" and its surrounding rooms. In addition, it also contains drawings of two series of scenes depicting various deities of Egypt in a kind of \"pantheon.\" The one is on the inner faces of the outer walls of the Temple Proper, the other on the exterior of the outer walls. The editors used this final volume to include key-plans for the recording of the Temple in the seven volumes, which should prove most useful. Equally welcome is a concordance of the \"Belegstellen\" to the Erman-Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache with the publication of Medinet Habu. The completion of the recording of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is a festive occasion not only for those directly connected with the project, but for the entire field of Egyptology. Gratitude and congratulations are to be extended to those who have spent time and energy to complete this record, and also to those who have made it possible. The Oriental Institute with its Epigraphic Survey has greatly helped the study of ancient Egypt and hopefully will continue it by recording the other monuments at Medinet Habu in like fashion. [From a review by Hans Goedicke in the American Journal of Archaeology 69 (1965) 271-72].",

Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III, The Epigraphic Survey, Oriental Institute Publications 8, 1930). The Ramesside temple and the High Gate were to occupy the efforts of the Survey for the next four decades, ending in 1970 with the appearance of Medinet Habu VIII. In resuming the Medinet Habu series, the Survey initiates what is envisioned to be a sequence of five volumes documenting the Eighteenth Dynasty temple of Amun and subsequent additions thereto, beginning with this publication of the reliefs in the six innermost rooms of the temple. These chambers were begun during the coregency of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and completed by the latter king during his sole reign.",

    "description": "At the end of the last century, during the first year of his commission to copy inscriptions for the proposed German-Egyptian dictionary, Professor James Henry Breasted wrote, \"I am now laying plans to copy not merely the historical, but allthe inscriptions of Egypt and publish them. This will require $25,000 a year for fifteen or twenty years.\" It was not until 1924 that he was able to put his plan into action. The initial site selected was the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. The first months of work by the Epigraphic Survey showed that a complete and accurate record required more time and care than Professor Breasted had envisaged. The methods of copying which he described in the first volume of Medinet Habu have been followed in all subsequent work of the expedition, and the Epigraphic Survey has produced what it believes are as accurate facsimile reproductions of the ancient reliefs as are possible. The present volume completes the documentation of the reliefs and inscriptions on the buildings at Medinet Habu constructed and decorated during the reign of Ramses III. Its Eastern High Gate is a structure unique among the extant ancient buildings of Egypt. The architecture has been studied by Professor Uvo Hölscher, and the relevant parts of his publications should be consulted. [From the Preface, p. xi, by Charles F. Nims].",

It was intended to be the final resting place for Kheruef, royal scribe and steward to Amenhotep III’s principal wife, Queen Tiye, but the tomb was abandoned before completion and Kheruef was apparently buried elsewhere. The significance of the tomb comes from the superb artistic quality of its reliefs and the historical information provided by some of the scenes and accompanying inscriptions for the transition from Amenhotep III’s reign to that of his son and successor, Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. The present volume, the outcome of a cooperative project started in 1957 by the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities of Egypt, is the definitive publication of the tomb.",

    "description": "This latest in the series of publications of the field work of the Epigraphic Survey is certainly the crowning achievement of the seventy years the Oriental Institute's artists and epigraphers have labored at the walls of the temples and tombs of Luxor, recording the inscriptions and reliefs in facsimile for posterity. Not only is The Festival Procession of Opet the Survey's largest volume to date, it is also the most sophisticated in terms of the finesse of the rendering of the facsimile drawings with indications of the different types of man-made and environmental damage suffered by the complicated surviving Luxor Temple Colonnade Hall reliefs indicated in minute details - which must have taken countless hours of inking by the many Survey artists (eighteen by actual count) who worked six months in the field each year recording the Opet Festival reliefs from 1974 to 1992. These marvelous large drawings (each a work of art in its own right), along with the accompanying text volume (with list of plates, preface, transliterations and translations of the texts, commentary, and glossary) make the (cost) of this achievement fully justified. Any serious student of the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty who orders [this volume] sight unseen will not be disappointed when it arrives. [From a book brief in KMT 5:4 (1994/95) 86].",

    "description": "The epigraphic record of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is completed. With the publication of this seventh volume the greatest and most painstaking epigraphic project ever undertaken in Egypt comes to an end. While excavations are likely to receive widespread attention, appreciation of the equally important, though less spectacular, epigraphic work is comparatively small. Its significance was properly conceived by the late James Henry Breasted, for whom the accurate recording of extant inscriptions was one of the main aims of the Oriental Institute at its founding. Copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions had been made since the days of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, but despite their merits those were not facsimiles, i.e., records which represent an inscription in exacting detail. When the Oriental Institute began its ambitious program no one could envisage the difficulties the epigraphic recording of a major monument would bring. Although it took long to complete the task, the accomplishments justify the efforts put into the project. Not only has the Oriental Institute provided a model publication of one of the most important monuments preserved from ancient Egypt, it also has set the standards for epigraphic recording. Volume VII records the scanty remains of the westernmost part of the Temple with the \"Holy of Holies\" and its surrounding rooms. In addition, it also contains drawings of two series of scenes depicting various deities of Egypt in a kind of \"pantheon.\" The one is on the inner faces of the outer walls of the Temple Proper, the other on the exterior of the outer walls. The editors used this final volume to include key-plans for the recording of the Temple in the seven volumes, which should prove most useful. Equally welcome is a concordance of the \"Belegstellen\" to the Erman-Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache with the publication of Medinet Habu. The completion of the recording of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is a festive occasion not only for those directly connected with the project, but for the entire field of Egyptology. Gratitude and congratulations are to be extended to those who have spent time and energy to complete this record, and also to those who have made it possible. The Oriental Institute with its Epigraphic Survey has greatly helped the study of ancient Egypt and hopefully will continue it by recording the other monuments at Medinet Habu in like fashion. [From a review by Hans Goedicke in the American Journal of Archaeology 69 (1965) 271-72].",

Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III, The Epigraphic Survey, Oriental Institute Publications 8, 1930). The Ramesside temple and the High Gate were to occupy the efforts of the Survey for the next four decades, ending in 1970 with the appearance of Medinet Habu VIII. In resuming the Medinet Habu series, the Survey initiates what is envisioned to be a sequence of five volumes documenting the Eighteenth Dynasty temple of Amun and subsequent additions thereto, beginning with this publication of the reliefs in the six innermost rooms of the temple. These chambers were begun during the coregency of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and completed by the latter king during his sole reign.",

    "description": "At the end of the last century, during the first year of his commission to copy inscriptions for the proposed German-Egyptian dictionary, Professor James Henry Breasted wrote, \"I am now laying plans to copy not merely the historical, but allthe inscriptions of Egypt and publish them. This will require $25,000 a year for fifteen or twenty years.\" It was not until 1924 that he was able to put his plan into action. The initial site selected was the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. The first months of work by the Epigraphic Survey showed that a complete and accurate record required more time and care than Professor Breasted had envisaged. The methods of copying which he described in the first volume of Medinet Habu have been followed in all subsequent work of the expedition, and the Epigraphic Survey has produced what it believes are as accurate facsimile reproductions of the ancient reliefs as are possible. The present volume completes the documentation of the reliefs and inscriptions on the buildings at Medinet Habu constructed and decorated during the reign of Ramses III. Its Eastern High Gate is a structure unique among the extant ancient buildings of Egypt. The architecture has been studied by Professor Uvo Hölscher, and the relevant parts of his publications should be consulted. [From the Preface, p. xi, by Charles F. Nims].",

    "description": "Tomb 192 in the Theban necropolis is the largest private tomb known from Dynasty XVIII. It was intended to be the final resting place for Kheruef, royal scribe and steward to Amenhotep III’s principal wife, Queen Tiye, but the tomb was abandoned before completion and Kheruef was apparently buried elsewhere. The significance of the tomb comes from the superb artistic quality of its reliefs and the historical information provided by some of the scenes and accompanying inscriptions for the transition from Amenhotep III’s reign to that of his son and successor, Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. The present volume, the outcome of a cooperative project started in 1957 by the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities of Egypt, is the definitive publication of the tomb.",

Not only is The Festival Procession of Opet the Survey's largest volume to date, it is also the most sophisticated in terms of the finesse of the rendering of the facsimile drawings with indications of the different types of man-made and environmental damage suffered by the complicated surviving Luxor Temple Colonnade Hall reliefs indicated in minute details - which must have taken countless hours of inking by the many Survey artists (eighteen by actual count) who worked six months in the field each year recording the Opet Festival reliefs from 1974 to 1992. These marvelous large drawings (each a work of art in its own right), along with the accompanying text volume (with list of plates, preface, transliterations and translations of the texts, commentary, and glossary) make the (cost) of this achievement fully justified. Any serious student of the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty who orders [this volume] sight unseen will not be disappointed when it arrives. [From a book brief in KMT 5:4 (1994/95) 86].",

    "description": "The epigraphic record of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is completed. With the publication of this seventh volume the greatest and most painstaking epigraphic project ever undertaken in Egypt comes to an end. While excavations are likely to receive widespread attention, appreciation of the equally important, though less spectacular, epigraphic work is comparatively small. Its significance was properly conceived by the late James Henry Breasted, for whom the accurate recording of extant inscriptions was one of the main aims of the Oriental Institute at its founding. Copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions had been made since the days of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, but despite their merits those were not facsimiles, i.e., records which represent an inscription in exacting detail. When the Oriental Institute began its ambitious program no one could envisage the difficulties the epigraphic recording of a major monument would bring. Although it took long to complete the task, the accomplishments justify the efforts put into the project. Not only has the Oriental Institute provided a model publication of one of the most important monuments preserved from ancient Egypt, it also has set the standards for epigraphic recording. Volume VII records the scanty remains of the westernmost part of the Temple with the \"Holy of Holies\" and its surrounding rooms. In addition, it also contains drawings of two series of scenes depicting various deities of Egypt in a kind of \"pantheon.\" The one is on the inner faces of the outer walls of the Temple Proper, the other on the exterior of the outer walls. The editors used this final volume to include key-plans for the recording of the Temple in the seven volumes, which should prove most useful. Equally welcome is a concordance of the \"Belegstellen\" to the Erman-Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache with the publication of Medinet Habu. The completion of the recording of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is a festive occasion not only for those directly connected with the project, but for the entire field of Egyptology. Gratitude and congratulations are to be extended to those who have spent time and energy to complete this record, and also to those who have made it possible. The Oriental Institute with its Epigraphic Survey has greatly helped the study of ancient Egypt and hopefully will continue it by recording the other monuments at Medinet Habu in like fashion.

Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III, The Epigraphic Survey, Oriental Institute Publications 8, 1930). The Ramesside temple and the High Gate were to occupy the efforts of the Survey for the next four decades, ending in 1970 with the appearance of Medinet Habu VIII. In resuming the Medinet Habu series, the Survey initiates what is envisioned to be a sequence of five volumes documenting the Eighteenth Dynasty temple of Amun and subsequent additions thereto, beginning with this publication of the reliefs in the six innermost rooms of the temple. These chambers were begun during the coregency of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and completed by the latter king during his sole reign.",

This will require $25,000 a year for fifteen or twenty years.\" It was not until 1924 that he was able to put his plan into action. The initial site selected was the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. The first months of work by the Epigraphic Survey showed that a complete and accurate record required more time and care than Professor Breasted had envisaged. The methods of copying which he described in the first volume of Medinet Habu have been followed in all subsequent work of the expedition, and the Epigraphic Survey has produced what it believes are as accurate facsimile reproductions of the ancient reliefs as are possible. The present volume completes the documentation of the reliefs and inscriptions on the buildings at Medinet Habu constructed and decorated during the reign of Ramses III. Its Eastern High Gate is a structure unique among the extant ancient buildings of Egypt. The architecture has been studied by Professor Uvo Hölscher, and the relevant parts of his publications should be consulted. [From the Preface, p. xi, by Charles F. Nims].",

It was intended to be the final resting place for Kheruef, royal scribe and steward to Amenhotep III’s principal wife, Queen Tiye, but the tomb was abandoned before completion and Kheruef was apparently buried elsewhere. The significance of the tomb comes from the superb artistic quality of its reliefs and the historical information provided by some of the scenes and accompanying inscriptions for the transition from Amenhotep III’s reign to that of his son and successor, Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. The present volume, the outcome of a cooperative project started in 1957 by the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities of Egypt, is the definitive publication of the tomb.",

Not only is The Festival Procession of Opet the Survey's largest volume to date, it is also the most sophisticated in terms of the finesse of the rendering of the facsimile drawings with indications of the different types of man-made and environmental damage suffered by the complicated surviving Luxor Temple Colonnade Hall reliefs indicated in minute details - which must have taken countless hours of inking by the many Survey artists (eighteen by actual count) who worked six months in the field each year recording the Opet Festival reliefs from 1974 to 1992. These marvelous large drawings (each a work of art in its own right), along with the accompanying text volume (with list of plates, preface, transliterations and translations of the texts, commentary, and glossary) make the (cost) of this achievement fully justified. Any serious student of the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty who orders [this volume] sight unseen will not be disappointed when it arrives. [From a book brief in KMT 5:4 (1994/95) 86].",

    "description": "The epigraphic record of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is completed. With the publication of this seventh volume the greatest and most painstaking epigraphic project ever undertaken in Egypt comes to an end. While excavations are likely to receive widespread attention, appreciation of the equally important, though less spectacular, epigraphic work is comparatively small. Its significance was properly conceived by the late James Henry Breasted, for whom the accurate recording of extant inscriptions was one of the main aims of the Oriental Institute at its founding. Copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions had been made since the days of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, but despite their merits those were not facsimiles, i.e., records which represent an inscription in exacting detail. When the Oriental Institute began its ambitious program no one could envisage the difficulties the epigraphic recording of a major monument would bring. Although it took long to complete the task, the accomplishments justify the efforts put into the project. Not only has the Oriental Institute provided a model publication of one of the most important monuments preserved from ancient Egypt, it also has set the standards for epigraphic recording. Volume VII records the scanty remains of the westernmost part of the Temple with the \"Holy of Holies\" and its surrounding rooms. In addition, it also contains drawings of two series of scenes depicting various deities of Egypt in a kind of \"pantheon.\" The one is on the inner faces of the outer walls of the Temple Proper, the other on the exterior of the outer walls. The editors used this final volume to include key-plans for the recording of the Temple in the seven volumes, which should prove most useful. Equally welcome is a concordance of the \"Belegstellen\" to the Erman-Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache with the publication of Medinet Habu. The completion of the recording of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is a festive occasion not only for those directly connected with the project, but for the entire field of Egyptology. Gratitude and congratulations are to be extended to those who have spent time and energy to complete this record, and also to those who have made it possible. The Oriental Institute with its Epigraphic Survey has greatly helped the study of ancient Egypt and hopefully will continue it by recording the other monuments at Medinet Habu in like fashion. [From a review by Hans Goedicke in the American Journal of Archaeology 69 (1965) 271-72].",

Earlier Historical Records of Ramses III, The Epigraphic Survey, Oriental Institute Publications 8, 1930). The Ramesside temple and the High Gate were to occupy the efforts of the Survey for the next four decades, ending in 1970 with the appearance of Medinet Habu VIII. In resuming the Medinet Habu series, the Survey initiates what is envisioned to be a sequence of five volumes documenting the Eighteenth Dynasty temple of Amun and subsequent additions thereto, beginning with this publication of the reliefs in the six innermost rooms of the temple. These chambers were begun during the coregency of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and completed by the latter king during his sole reign.",

    "description": "At the end of the last century, during the first year of his commission to copy inscriptions for the proposed German-Egyptian dictionary, Professor James Henry Breasted wrote, \"I am now laying plans to copy not merely the historical, but allthe inscriptions of Egypt and publish them. This will require $25,000 a year for fifteen or twenty years.\" It was not until 1924 that he was able to put his plan into action. The initial site selected was the Mortuary Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. The first months of work by the Epigraphic Survey showed that a complete and accurate record required more time and care than Professor Breasted had envisaged. The methods of copying which he described in the first volume of Medinet Habu have been followed in all subsequent work of the expedition, and the Epigraphic Survey has produced what it believes are as accurate facsimile reproductions of the ancient reliefs as are possible. The present volume completes the documentation of the reliefs and inscriptions on the buildings at Medinet Habu constructed and decorated during the reign of Ramses III. Its Eastern High Gate is a structure unique among the extant ancient buildings of Egypt. The architecture has been studied by Professor Uvo Hölscher, and the relevant parts of his publications should be consulted. [From the Preface, p. xi, by Charles F. Nims].",

It was intended to be the final resting place for Kheruef, royal scribe and steward to Amenhotep III’s principal wife, Queen Tiye, but the tomb was abandoned before completion and Kheruef was apparently buried elsewhere. The significance of the tomb comes from the superb artistic quality of its reliefs and the historical information provided by some of the scenes and accompanying inscriptions for the transition from Amenhotep III’s reign to that of his son and successor, Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten. The present volume, the outcome of a cooperative project started in 1957 by the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Department of Antiquities of Egypt, is the definitive publication of the tomb.",

    "description": "This latest in the series of publications of the field work of the Epigraphic Survey is certainly the crowning achievement of the seventy years the Oriental Institute's artists and epigraphers have labored at the walls of the temples and tombs of Luxor, recording the inscriptions and reliefs in facsimile for posterity. Not only is The Festival Procession of Opet the Survey's largest volume to date, it is also the most sophisticated in terms of the finesse of the rendering of the facsimile drawings with indications of the different types of man-made and environmental damage suffered by the complicated surviving Luxor Temple Colonnade Hall reliefs indicated in minute details - which must have taken countless hours of inking by the many Survey artists (eighteen by actual count) who worked six months in the field each year recording the Opet Festival reliefs from 1974 to 1992. These marvelous large drawings (each a work of art in its own right), along with the accompanying text volume (with list of plates, preface, transliterations and translations of the texts, commentary, and glossary) make the (cost) of this achievement fully justified. Any serious student of the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty who orders [this volume] sight unseen will not be disappointed when it arrives. [From a book brief in KMT 5:4 (1994/95) 86].",

Included in this volume are reconstructions of the Eighteenth Dynasty facade of the hall, the northern and southern doorjamb reliefs, the upper register scenes, the decoration of the columns and their architraves, the dedicatory bandeau texts of the New Kingdom, graffiti from the later periods, and the three colossal statues that still stand in the northern end of the hall. The plates are accompanied by a booklet of translations and commentary on the iconographic and textual additions and revisions that were made by a long succession of Egyptian rulers and reflect the complex history of the monument.",
